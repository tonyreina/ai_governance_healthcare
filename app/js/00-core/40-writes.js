/* Changelog coalescing.

   One entry per completed edit, not per keystroke and not per save.

   Two earlier versions were wrong in instructive ways. Logging inside edit()
   wrote one entry per character: forty entries to record one sentence, burying
   the record it exists to document. Logging at save-flush was better but still
   split a sentence in two whenever the typist paused longer than the 550ms
   save debounce -- which is just "stopped to think mid-sentence", a completely
   normal thing to do.

   So the trigger is the edit being FINISHED, which for a text field means
   focus leaving it. Saving still debounces independently: data is written
   while you type, and the changelog describes what you wrote once you are
   done. The two concerns were conflated; they are now separate.

   Discrete controls -- a status button, a dropdown, a date picker -- are
   complete the moment they change, so they flush immediately. */
