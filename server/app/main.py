"""The FastAPI application.

Serves the API only. The dashboard itself is static and is served by the proxy
in front (``proxy/Caddyfile``), which is also what terminates SSO -- see
``docs/deploy.md``.

Two defaults here are deliberate and worth not changing by accident:

**CORS is off.** The browser app is served from the same origin as the API, by
the same proxy, so it never makes a cross-origin request. Turning CORS on would
only widen who can call the API from a page they control. ``CORS_ORIGINS`` can
switch it on for a split deployment, and takes an explicit list -- never ``*``,
which with credentials is both insecure and rejected by browsers anyway.

**Cross-site writes are refused.** Identity comes from a proxy that decides
based on its own session, which a browser attaches to cross-site requests too.
``Sec-Fetch-Site`` is checked on every non-GET; see the middleware below.

**No ``--proxy-headers``.** uvicorn's proxy-header handling rewrites the peer
address from ``X-Forwarded-For``, which the client controls. ``TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR``
in ``app/auth.py`` checks the *real* TCP peer, and that check is only meaningful
while the real peer is what the app sees.

    Named for what it does: entries are discarded once they fall outside

    allowances across it.

    **In-process, and so per-replica.** With N replicas behind a load
    balancer the effective ceiling is N x ``max_requests``, because nothing is
    shared between them. That is a deliberate trade: a shared counter means
    Redis, or a round trip to PostgreSQL on every request, and this limiter
    exists to blunt a runaway client rather than to meter an API. Size the
    limit for one replica and treat the total as approximate. The hard
    protections are elsewhere -- the body cap below, the SSE stream cap, and
    the network isolation that keeps unauthenticated traffic out entirely.

    **Bounded memory.** Keys are swept once per window. Without that the

    address ever seen and never shrank, which for IP-keyed traffic is an

    This cannot be a ``@app.middleware("http")`` function, and the reason is
    worth recording because the first version was one and looked correct.

    Starlette's ``BaseHTTPMiddleware`` hands the downstream app its own
    receive channel. A dispatch function that reads the body to measure it --
    with ``await request.body()`` or by draining ``request.stream()`` -- has
    consumed it, and assigning ``request._receive`` puts it back only on the
    middleware's OWN ``Request`` object. The route constructs a new one and
    sees nothing. The result was that any request without a Content-Length,
    which is every chunked request, reached the route with an EMPTY body and
    failed validation with a 422 that had nothing to do with what was sent.
    Content-Length requests were unaffected, which is why the browser app and
    the original tests never showed it.

    Wrapping ``receive`` at the ASGI level measures the body without
    consuming it: each chunk is counted and passed straight through. Nothing
    is buffered, so the limit is enforced on the first chunk that crosses it
    rather than after the whole body has been read into memory.
