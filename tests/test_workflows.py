"""Unit tests for the CI configuration itself.

CI once ran the linters and no tests at all (#32): twenty-four test files, every
regression test for a closed security finding among them, ran only when someone
remembered. That is a failure of configuration, and configuration can be tested.

What is asserted, and why each one earns its place:

* every `pixi run test-*` task is run by .github/workflows/test.yml. A test added
  later cannot be silently left out of CI, which is how the gap opened;
* every tests/test_*.py file is reachable from a pixi task, so a test cannot be
  orphaned either;
* REQUIRE_TESTS is set, so a suite that cannot run fails instead of skipping
  (a skip exits 0 and reads as a pass);
* nothing may `continue-on-error`, and every job has a timeout;
* the Postgres in CI is the major version compose.yaml pins;
* one aggregate job depends on all the others, so branch protection can require a
  single name and a new job cannot be forgotten.

Each rule has a mutation test: break a copy of the real workflow and demand the
rule notice. A check that is never shown to fail is a claim, not a control.
