"""Shared fixtures.

Two kinds of test live here. The pure ones -- deep-merge semantics, identity
header parsing -- need nothing but Python and always run. The rest need a real
PostgreSQL, because what they are testing *is* the database's behavior: a row
lock serializing two concurrent PATCHes, a unique constraint producing one 409,
a trigger refusing an UPDATE. A fake would test the fake.

Run everything with::

    docker run -d --name chai-test-db -p 55432:5432 \
      -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=test -e POSTGRES_DB=chai_test postgres:16-alpine
    TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:test@localhost:55432/chai_test \
      pytest

Without ``TEST_DATABASE_URL`` the database tests skip and say why.
