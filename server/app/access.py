"""Per-project access control, enforced.

This mirrors ``app/js/00-core/15-access.js``. The browser copy decides what to
SHOW; this one decides what the server will ACCEPT, and only the second is a
control. Anyone can open the console and flip a flag in the first. Keep the two
in step: a permission added there and not here is a label, not a rule.

The model, in one line each:

* **owner**  -- delete, archive, purge history, and change who else has access
* **writer** -- fill in the review
* **reader** -- see it, change nothing

Two deliberate holes, both load-bearing:

1. **A project with no owners is unrestricted.** Records created before access
   control existed have no owner list. Treating that as "nobody may touch it"
   would lock a team out of its own governance history, so it reads as "not yet
   claimed". The first person to claim it becomes its owner.

2. **With identity disabled, everything is permitted.** If the deployment is
   not behind an identity-providing proxy there is nobody to check a list
   against, and pretending otherwise would be security theater. The API says so
   at /api/health rather than quietly allowing everything.
