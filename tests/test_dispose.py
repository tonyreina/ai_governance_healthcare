"""`make dispose`: the operator's side of disposal at the end of retention (#57).

The rules are in the database and are tested there (server/tests/test_retention.py).
This tests the script an operator runs: that its report names what is due and never
what a record says, that it changes nothing without --apply, that --apply needs the
name of whoever runs it, and that applying it, against a real PostgreSQL with the real
migrations, disposes of what was reported and records the run. Needs Docker.
