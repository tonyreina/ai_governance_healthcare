"""The build manifest: what the server needs to know about the frameworks a page was
built with (#168 PR C, D-76).

``scripts/build_app.py`` writes it beside the page (``docs/app/manifest.json`` for
the default build). The migrate job reads it (``server/app/retirement.py``) and
loads the retirement pairs into ``retirement_rule``, so the server decides when a
record is retired, and so when disposal is due (R-56, R-66), from the same
definitions the page runs.

Per framework: its id, role, version, the SHA-256 of its definition's canonical JSON,
and its retirement pairs, every (gate id, option value) whose class ends a project,
which is what the engine's ``phase()`` treats as Stopped or Retired. Then the hash of
the primary's rule set, which ``/api/health`` reports back.

Standard library only: the server's tests import it to build stand-in manifests, and
the server image does not carry the checker's dependencies.
