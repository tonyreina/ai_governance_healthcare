"""Reading a governance record must leave a trace (#33).

Every read route returned data and wrote nothing, and the exports never touched the
server at all. So "account X was compromised on the 3rd and closed on the 9th; which
records did it open, and did it export any?" had no answer anywhere in the stack, and
every breach would be scoped to the whole portfolio by default (GDPR Art. 33(3)(a)).
45 CFR 164.312(b), audit controls, is *required*.

`access_event` is that record: append-only like the audit log, with no foreign key so it
outlives the project, and written in the same transaction as the read it describes. The
same fact also goes out as a security event, which is the copy a database administrator
cannot alter.
