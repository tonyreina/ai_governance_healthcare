"""The British-spelling guard, tested as a guardrail (#169).

scripts/check_spelling.py runs in pre-commit and CI and had no tests, so nothing
showed it failing. It missed a plural in docs/developing.md because only the
singular was listed: a word list of exact forms catches the forms someone
thought to type, and every other inflection of the same root passes in silence.

What is pinned, both ways:

* every word the checker generates, and every word of the table, is caught in
  prose, in a code comment, in a string, and as a part of an identifier
  (snake_case, camelCase, kebab-case), in lower, Title and UPPER case;
* a table written by hand, independently of the checker, is caught with the
  American form it names. It names every EXPLICIT word, a form of every stem,
  ending and prefix of every family, and a form of every MEDICAL stem and
  prefix, and the tests demand it does, so dropping any part of the checker
  leaves a row uncaught; no EXPLICIT word may also be generated, so dropping one
  is always noticed; no MEDICAL form has a Latin ending, and no British word is
  spelled with the letters a-f alone;
* a lowercase word holding a British medical segment anywhere is reported by
  its shape (SHAPED, and the verifier's 131 medical words in
  spelling_corpus/medical.txt), after any capitalized word (the verifier's 132
  sentence openers), and never suggested in the patch; each pattern alone
  catches a word, and each narrowing keeps an American word clean; a
  capitalized word, hex, a Latin ending or epithet, an exception and a word the
  dictionary accepts are not;
* the epithet of a binomial is not reported after a genus in GENERA or an
  abbreviated one, past markup and across a line, and is reported after any
  other word or with an English ending;
* no rule matches a lowercase word of the en_US Hunspell dictionary (pinned in
  pixi.toml), read as the checker reads words, except the two in
  CAUGHT_ON_PURPOSE, which CLAUDE.md rules out;
* a British word written with a ligature ("oe" or "ae" as one letter) is caught,
  and a word with an accented letter ("décentre", "réanalyse") is not English
  and is not read;
* American words, and American words a careless new stem would generate
  ("precise", "compelled", "lustring", "improvisation", "leucovorin"), are not
  flagged;
* the verifier's corpus (tests/fixtures/spelling_corpus/): every clean line
  (organisms, drugs, places, titles, names, code, URLs, hex, encoded data, the
  binomial wrapped across lines) produces no finding; no line of names is in
  the suggestion patch; every British line is found, and suggested exactly
  where it may be; Python's own spelling passes in a .py file; and the
  demonstration that the first version corrupted produces no suggestion;
* --fix never writes: no file's bytes or modification time change, for every
  kind of file and for the whole corpus, named or found by a whole-repository
  run. It prints a patch, under a header that says it is a suggestion, that
  `git apply --check` accepts on a copy and that makes exactly the expected
  text (a last line with no newline, CRLF endings, a form feed, the English
  catalog, several files); and it lists the rest for a person;
* the patch suggests a hit only when it is listed, all lowercase, in a
  Markdown, reStructuredText or plain-text file or a value of app/i18n/en.json,
  not in code, and standing alone between whitespace with only an opening
  bracket, a quote or "*" before it and only those that close, "*" or ",;:.!?"
  after it; FIX_CASES pins every boundary character both ways, every kind of
  file, every kind of code, and each of the verifier's cases; the report says,
  of each hit the patch leaves, why;
* the patch never names a file skip() skips;
* URLs of every listed scheme, also after "_" and not inside a longer word,
  email and git addresses, domains, file names, paths (with ./, ../, ~/ or /,
  or an extension), digests and encoded data from 16 characters are neither
  reported nor suggested, while an identifier with a digit is still read, and
  an abbreviation with dots ("e.g.") is no file extension;
* `.cancelled()` is exempt only as a method call in a .py file;
* a slash in prose (two words joined by "/") is not a path, while a URL, ./, ../, an
  absolute path and a path with a file extension are; a URL needs "://" or a
  listed scheme, and ends at whitespace; a segment ending in a dot has no
  extension, nor does a dot inside a segment;
* `spelling-ok`, in lowercase, exempts its own line and no other; a
  `.spelling-allow` entry exempts its exact phrase as a whole, in its own case
  (a mixed-case one too), only in the files its glob names, matched against the
  path from the repository root, and an entry with no glob is refused, by
  parse_allowlist() and by the command, which exits 1;
* a file that is not UTF-8, or cannot be read at all, is reported, not passed;
* targets() and skip() read every kind of text file pre-commit would pass (code,
  documentation, .css, .html, .txt, .rst, .svg, a Makefile, a shell script, a
  .caddy file, .env.example, the ignore files, a lock file, a LICENSE) and none
  of our real files is skipped, while a binary file, a symbolic link,
  translations, SKIP_DIRS and QUOTED_VERBATIM (each pinned to exactly its
  entries), the corpus's own files, the allowlist and the checker itself are;
  BEL, BS, VT, FF and ESC bytes are text, a DEL byte is not, only the first
  1024 bytes are read to decide, and a file that cannot be opened counts as
  text;
* the command exits nonzero on a hit, or a file it cannot read, and zero on
  clean input; so does --fix.

Then the checker is broken on purpose, at least once for each property above
(MUTATIONS lists them), and the same assertions must notice. A check never
shown to fail is a claim, not a control. One mutation proposed in review is not
here because it changes nothing: removing a lookbehind from the slash pattern,
which matched from the leftmost character anyway, so the lookbehind was
deleted instead.

The tests of the in-place rewrite that --fix used to do were deleted with it,
not weakened: what they pinned (where a rewrite may happen) is now pinned as
what the patch suggests.

The British words below are test data, so their lines carry `spelling-ok`.
