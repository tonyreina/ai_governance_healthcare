"""Restore a backup into a throwaway PostgreSQL and check that it is a backup (#52).

`make backup` writes an encrypted dump and nothing ever read one back, so the restore
path was an assumption. 45 CFR 164.308(a)(7): a data backup plan is *required*, and
testing it is addressable. The dump holds the evidence that a clinical AI deployment was
reviewed, and it cannot be reconstructed by re-entry. A backup that has never been
restored is a hypothesis; this makes it a check.

    python3 scripts/verify_backup.py                 # the newest dump in backups/
    python3 scripts/verify_backup.py FILE            # a specific one
    make verify-backup [FILE=...]

It starts a throwaway PostgreSQL of the SAME MAJOR VERSION as production (read from
compose.yaml, so the test cannot drift from what runs), with no network and its data
on tmpfs, streams the dump into it (decrypting with BACKUP_PASSPHRASE for a `.gpg`),
and checks what the dump is FOR: the tables exist, the rows came back, and **the
append-only triggers are present and enabled**, because a dump that restores into a
database without them, or with them switched off, has quietly lost the guarantee the
history's value rests on. From migration 010 it also checks that the retirement rules
are exactly the ones their history last recorded (D-76). The container is always
removed.

What it cannot tell you: that the dump is recent, that it contains everything (it
can only compare counts to what the dump says), or that your off-host copy is the
same file. It exits 0 only if the restore ran cleanly and nothing it checks is
missing.
