# Exports

A review leaves the dashboard in four ways, each for a different reader.

| Export | For | Format | Language |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Report** | A board, an auditor, a regulator, an insurer | Standalone HTML, PDF, or Markdown | The reader's, and it says which |
| **Project data** | A script, another copy of the tool, or an analyst | JSON, one file per project | English |
| **Portfolio** | A spreadsheet | CSV, one row per project | English |
| **Dataset metadata** | A repository that indexes datasets | Croissant JSON-LD, made by a Python script | English |

The report buttons are on the *Report* step: **Download report (HTML)**,
**Download PDF**, **Download Markdown** and **Download project data (JSON)**.
The portfolio CSV is on the home page.

## What every export says about where it came from

A copy that has left the tool is easy to mistake for the record. So each export
says which storage mode produced it, in the header's own words: *This browser
only* or *Shared workspace*, with a sentence on what that mode does and does
not guarantee. In the report it is a note at the end. In the JSON
it is a `storage` object with the mode, the label and the note. In the CSV it is
a **Stored in** column.

That storage note is safety-bearing: in a language whose translation has not been
reviewed, it stays in English in the report (see
[Developing it](developing.md#languages)).

A report is also tied to the record it came from by the **record
fingerprint**, which every export carries: a SHA-256 and an MD5 of the project.
The JSON has them in a `fingerprint` object, with the project's id beside it; the
HTML report, the PDF it prints and the Markdown report print them at the end. The
MD5 is the one the project's setup page and change log show, so a fingerprint
quoted beside a report ties it to the record on screen.

The fingerprint shows whether two copies are the same version. It does not prove
nobody altered the record: anyone who can edit a file can recompute its hash, so
a hash proves tampering only if it was kept somewhere the editor could not reach,
such as in your own records system when the report was filed. SHA-256 is the
digest to quote for that; MD5 has been collision-broken since 2004 and is a
version label, not a seal.

You can check a JSON export against its own fingerprint:

```bash
python examples/load_export.py my-project-chai-review.json
# ...
#   fingerprint: SHA-256 3f1a9c0e5b7d2a46...  matches the record
```

It recomputes both digests from the file alone, over the record (the `_state` and
the project id) as compact canonical JSON in UTF-8: keys sorted at every level,
with the volatile fields `updatedAt`, `updatedBy`, `cardUpdatedAt`, `_state`,
`contentHash` and `generated` left out. An export from before fingerprints were
added reports that it has none.

On the shared server, the dashboard reports each export it produces, so it
appears in the read trail beside the reads that fetched the data
([Cloud deployment](deploy.md#the-read-trail)). That is a record of ordinary
use, not a control: a modified client could omit it.

Whatever a person typed stays text in every export. In the HTML report and the PDF
it is escaped, in the Markdown report it is ended at the line and has the
characters Markdown reads as structure escaped, so a value cannot start a heading,
become a link or an image, or add raw HTML, and in the CSV a cell a spreadsheet
would run as a formula is neutralized.

## The report

The report has the status and its flags, readiness by stage and by principle, the
checkpoint decisions and who recorded them, the open gaps with their owners and
due dates, the applied model card, the sign-off history and, in an appendix, the
whole checklist. It closes with a disclaimer: it is an internal governance record,
not a certification, legal opinion or regulatory determination.

### PDF

**Download PDF** opens your browser's print dialog on the standalone report;
choose *Save as PDF*.

!!! note "Why the print dialog rather than a one-click download"

    No PDF library is bundled. Every option weighs hundreds of kilobytes, and
    the dashboard has to stay one self-contained file small enough to read in
    one sitting: a PDF writer would be larger than the whole application.

    Browsers already render HTML to PDF well, with real fonts, selectable text
    and working links. A canvas-based library gives you an image of a document
    instead.

What gets printed is exactly the standalone HTML export, rendered in an
offscreen frame, not the page you are looking at. So the PDF and the HTML
download are the same document, and the app's own navigation never appears in
it. It is also the one export that keeps working where file downloads are
unavailable, since it goes through the print dialog rather than a download API.

## Project data (JSON)

Each project exports as JSON, validated by
[`schema/project.schema.json`](https://github.com/tonyreina/ai_governance_healthcare/blob/main/schema/project.schema.json)
(`chai-review/2`). The file holds the status, phase, next review date and flags
as computed at export time; the project's `meta`, checkpoint decisions and metrics;
the model card; the whole checklist with each criterion's status, evidence, owner
and due date; the scores; and `_state`, the project as the tool stores it.

Only `_state` is read back. Everything else is derived for the reader's
convenience. **Import project JSON** on the home page reads `_state` and creates
a **new** project.

!!! note "Import creates a new project"

    Importing does not merge into the project the file came from: it creates a
    separate one. Retire or delete the original if you meant to replace it.

## Portfolio (CSV)

**Export portfolio (CSV)** writes one row per project, as the dashboard shows
it: project, developer, clinical sponsor, risk tier, lifecycle phase, status,
readiness, next review, flags, whether it is archived, when it was last updated,
and where it is stored.

## Reading an export in Python

Four scripts in `examples/` work on exports. Run them from the repository root.

```bash
python examples/load_export.py my-project-chai-review.json
```

prints a summary of the project and, if pandas is installed, its open gaps.

### Feeding evaluation metrics back in

`fairlearn_to_metrics.py` and `error_cohorts_to_metrics.py` are libraries, not
commands. They append your evaluation results to an export's key metrics, so they
flow into the model card:

```python
from fairlearn.metrics import MetricFrame
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score
from fairlearn_to_metrics import load, add_metrics, metricframe_to_rows, save

mf = MetricFrame(
    metrics={"Sensitivity": recall_score},
    y_true=y_test,
    y_pred=y_pred,
    sensitive_features=X_test[["age_band", "sex"]],
)
export = load("deterioration-index-chai-review.json")
add_metrics(export, metricframe_to_rows(mf))
save(export, "deterioration-index-with-fairness.json")
```

`error_cohorts_to_metrics.py` goes looking for subgroups nobody pre-specified. It
fits a shallow decision tree to the model's *errors*, so the leaves describe where
the model goes wrong, and writes the cohorts that fare materially worse than the
whole as metric rows with their size. A cohort found this way is a lead to
investigate, not a finding: it does not show a disparity is unfair or causal, and
small cohorts are noisy. Both scripts need `pandas`; the first needs `fairlearn`
and the second `scikit-learn`.

Re-import the resulting file from the dashboard with **Import project JSON**.

## Croissant

`croissant_export.py` converts a project export into
[Croissant](https://docs.mlcommons.org/croissant/) 1.0 metadata with the
[Responsible AI extension](https://github.com/mlcommons/croissant/blob/main/docs/croissant-rai-spec.md),
so a governance record can be published as machine-readable dataset metadata.

```bash
python examples/croissant_export.py my-project-chai-review.json -o dataset.jsonld
```

The output validates against `mlcroissant`.

### What it describes, and what it refuses to

Croissant describes a **dataset**. A governance record describes a **model** and
an **organizational process**. The exporter keeps that distinction rather than
blurring it:

- `name` and `description` describe the *development and validation data
  extract*.
- The solution itself is carried under `about` as an `sc:SoftwareApplication`.
- The governance record is linked via `isBasedOn`, not transcribed.
- Four governance facts are emitted in this project's own
  [`chai:` namespace](ns/index.md).

The checklist, the checkpoint decisions and the readiness scores are **not**
exported. Croissant has no vocabulary for assurance attestations, and
`sc:creativeWorkStatus` describes the editorial status of a work, not a
governance body's decision to expose patients to a model.

!!! warning "Cohort detail is withheld by default"

    `rai:dataCollection` carries cohort size, dates, sites and demographics by
    design, and Croissant files exist to be published and indexed. A small-cell
    cohort description attributed to a named organization can be re-identifying.

    Pass `--include-cohort-detail` to emit it. Check for small cells first.

!!! warning "People are not named by default"

    The review team and clinical sponsor are personal data, and a published
    record that names them links identified individuals to a named clinical
    system, a site and a time. By default `maintainer` is an organizational
    contact (*AI Governance Committee, <your organization>*), or is left out when
    no organization is recorded.

    Pass `--include-maintainer-names` to publish the review team (or, if there is
    none, the sponsor) by name. The exporter then prints a warning that lists
    exactly what it published.

### No fabricated structure

The exporter emits no `distribution` and no `recordSet`. A governance record
contains no file hashes, no content URLs and no column names, and synthesizing
them to satisfy a validator would manufacture provenance for clinical data the
tool has never seen. Croissant 1.0 accepts a metadata-only record.

For the same reason it asserts no `license` for the data, only `sdLicense` for
the metadata record. `mlcroissant` warns that `license` is recommended; that
warning is correct, and a human should answer it.

### BioCroissant

[BioCroissant](https://github.com/mlcommons/BioCroissant) is the biomedical
extension of Croissant. As of this writing its repository is a **skeleton**:
its own READMEs state "no schema files yet" and "no implementation yet".

A draft `bio:` vocabulary exists in the prototype its READMEs point to,
[biocroissant-to-omop](https://github.com/renato-umeton/biocroissant-to-omop),
which marks itself `PLACEHOLDER` because the context IRI
`https://mlcommons.org/croissant/bio/0.3/context` does not resolve.

```bash
python examples/croissant_export.py export.json --profile biocroissant-draft
```

This is **off by default and experimental**. Emitting terms under a prefix that
does not resolve is a real defect in published linked data, defensible only as a
labeled opt-in. The output carries a `_contextNote` saying so, and still
validates. `conformsTo` is an array from the start, so adopting BioCroissant
properly later means appending one string.
