# Design decisions

Why the project is built the way it is, so the reasoning is not rediscovered
the hard way. Requirements say what must stay true; this file says why a given
approach was chosen and what was rejected. See [REQUIREMENTS.md](REQUIREMENTS.md).

How this file is used is set out in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). In short: new code
follows an **Accepted** decision unless the user says otherwise, and a change
of mind adds a new entry that supersedes the old one. Never edit history.

Each entry has a stable ID. Never renumber or reuse one. A decision that no
longer holds is marked **Superseded by D-nn** and left in place.

**Status** is one of:

- **Accepted**: in force, and reflected in the code.
- **Proposed**: argued for and filed, not yet built or confirmed by the owner.
  Do not treat it as settled.
- **Superseded**: replaced. Kept for the history.

Entry shape: the decision, why, what was rejected, and where it comes from.

## Identity and the network

### D-01 Caddy, not nginx, as the identity boundary

- Status: Accepted
- Header deletion is a first-class verb in Caddy (`request_header -X`), where
  nginx can only send an empty header and silently does nothing if another
  `proxy_set_header` appears in a more specific block. SSE works by default.
  The whole config is one file.
- Rejected: nginx. Three ways to get the identity strip or SSE streaming subtly
  wrong, each with a failure that looks like an application bug.
- Source: `proxy/Caddyfile` header comment.

### D-02 The identity strip and set run in a fixed order

- Status: Accepted
- Strip the canonical headers, set them from the configured source, then strip
  the provider headers, reject if empty, forward. The provider strip must come
  after the set, because the set reads a provider header through a placeholder.
- Why it is written down: the strip once came first, which made every documented
  cloud deployment resolve to an empty identity and answer 401, invisibly, for
  months (#23).
- Source: `proxy/Caddyfile`; `tests/test_proxy_identity.py`.

### D-03 No password login

- Status: Accepted
- There is no user table, hash, registration form or token endpoint. Sign-in is
  the hospital's identity provider; the application learns who you are from one
  header.
- Why: offboarding works because disabling a user in the directory ends access
  everywhere at once; MFA is whatever the hospital already requires; password
  policy is the security office's job; and every credential feature is a thing
  to get wrong in a tool whose authentication surface is one header.
- Rejected: local accounts (the FastAPI `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm` pattern).
- Source: `docs/deploy.md`, "Why there is no password login"; closed issue #28.

### D-04 Network isolation, not code, is the boundary

- Status: Accepted
- The API publishes no host port. The only network `api` shares with anything
  internet-facing is `edge`, and the only other member is `proxy`. The database
  sits on an `internal: true` network with no gateway.
- Why: a header is trivially forged, and no code in the API can compensate for a
  reachable port. `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR` and `PROXY_SHARED_SECRET` are defense in
  depth, not substitutes.
- Source: `compose.yaml` header; `server/app/auth.py`.
- Known issue, fixed: `PROXY_SHARED_SECRET` was documented but no shipped config
  sent it, so enabling it made every request 403 (#61). See D-30.

### D-05 No `--proxy-headers`

- Status: Accepted
- uvicorn is not run with proxy-header handling, because that rewrites the peer
  address from `X-Forwarded-For`, which the client controls, and
  `TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR` would then be checking the attacker's own claim.
- Source: `server/app/main.py` docstring.

### D-06 CSRF defense is `Sec-Fetch-Site`, and CORS is off

- Status: Accepted
- The proxy authenticates on its own session, which a browser attaches to
  cross-site requests too. CORS governs reading a response, not whether a delete
  happened. `Sec-Fetch-Site` is set by the browser and cannot be altered by
  script. A request without it is a non-browser client and is allowed.
- Source: `server/app/main.py`, `reject_cross_site_writes`; closed issue #9.

## Data

### D-07 The project document is opaque `jsonb`

- Status: Accepted
- One `jsonb` column rather than a column per field, so the browser's schema can
  grow without a migration. The API treats the document as opaque apart from the
  merge rule (objects merge key by key, arrays replace).
- Source: `server/migrations/001_init.sql`.

### D-08 The merge runs in Python under a row lock

- Status: Accepted
- A read-modify-write inside a transaction holding `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`.
- Rejected: a recursive `jsonb` merge in PL/pgSQL. It would be atomic too, but it
  is a second implementation of a rule the browser already defines in
  `app/js/00-core/00-util.js`, and two implementations drift. PostgreSQL's `||`
  is not an option at all: it merges only the top level.
- Source: `server/app/routes.py`, `patch_project` docstring.

### D-09 Version history stores full documents, not diffs

- Status: Accepted
- A governance record is kilobytes and a committee edits it a few times a week.
  Reconstructing a point in time by replaying diffs is the operation you least
  want to debug while answering a regulator.
- Cost: unbounded growth with no retention policy (#54).
- Source: `server/migrations/002_versions.sql`.

### D-10 History survives deletion, with no foreign key

- Status: Accepted
- `project_version` deliberately has no foreign key to `projects`. "The record
  was deleted on this date, and here is what it contained" is itself an audit
  finding. The audit log cascades because it belongs to the live project.
- Consequence: DELETE does not erase content, which collides with erasure (#36).
- Source: `002_versions.sql`.

### D-11 Disposal is a tombstone

- Status: Accepted
- Purge empties `doc` and keeps the row, with `purged_at` and `purged_by`, rather
  than deleting. A vanished row is indistinguishable from a snapshot never taken.
  The trigger permits exactly that transition and nothing else.
- Source: `server/migrations/003_version_access.sql`.

### D-12 Each snapshot carries the access list it was written under

- Status: Accepted
- Otherwise deleting a project removed its live row, the access check was
  skipped, and every retained snapshot became readable by anyone. Deleting a
  restricted record widened access to it.
- Source: `003_version_access.sql`.

### D-13 An incarnation separates reused project ids

- Status: Accepted
- Project ids are caller-chosen and snapshots outlive their project, so a new
  project reusing an id collided with the old history. An incarnation column
  keeps the histories apart.
- Source: `server/migrations/004_version_incarnation.sql`; closed issue #10.

### D-14 Postgres is pinned to a major version

- Status: Accepted
- Postgres does not migrate its on-disk format. Moving 17 to 18 under a live
  volume makes the cluster unreadable and needs `pg_upgrade` or a dump and
  restore. A floating tag would do that on an unrelated `docker compose pull`.
- Source: `compose.yaml`.

## Operations

### D-15 The dashboard is built on the host, not in Docker

- Status: Accepted
- `pixi run build-app` generates `docs/app/index.html`, which the proxy mounts
  read-only. For the cloud, `proxy/Dockerfile` copies it in.
- Source: `compose.yaml`; `proxy/Dockerfile`.

### D-16 The rate limiter is in-process and per replica

- Status: Accepted
- With N replicas the effective ceiling is N times the limit. A shared counter
  would mean Redis or a database round trip per request, for a limiter whose job
  is to blunt a runaway client, not to meter an API. The hard protections are the
  body cap, the SSE stream cap and network isolation.
- Source: `server/app/main.py`, `SlidingWindowRateLimiter` docstring.

### D-17 Backups are `pg_dump` through the running server, encrypted

- Status: Accepted
- Never a copy of the volume's files, which gives a torn snapshot of a live
  cluster. `gpg --symmetric` because it is on far more machines than `age`.
- Source: `Makefile`, `backup` target.

### D-18 `make doctor` checks the password over the API's own path

- Status: Accepted
- `initdb` trusts the Unix socket and loopback, and only the appended
  `host all all all scram-sha-256` line asks for a password. A check using
  `-h 127.0.0.1` passes against a database it is locked out of. `-h db` is the
  only path that tests anything.
- Source: `scripts/doctor.py`; closed issue #26.

## Engineering

### D-19 Enumerated types, enforced by a ratcheting checker

- Status: Accepted
- A closed set of values gets a `StrEnum` (Python) or a frozen object
  (JavaScript). The existing bare-string uses are baselined and may only shrink.
- Why a custom checker and not ruff's `PLR2004`: it produced about 190 hits,
  mostly protocol constants and punctuation, and a noisy guardrail gets switched
  off. The ratchet means legacy code does not block work and new code cannot add
  to the problem.
- Why tests are exempt: a test may pin a wire value on purpose, and that is the
  test that proves a field was not silently renamed.
- Hardened after an adversarial review: 28 evasions were reproduced, 20 closed
  (inline `frozenset` and dict membership, `is`, hyphenated values, `Literal`
  aliases, `Field(pattern=...)`, JS `.includes`, backticks, comparisons wrapped
  across lines, and a pragma hidden in a string). The scanner reads real
  comments, so a pragma only counts in one.
- Hook scope: the first version fired only on Write and Edit, which skips most of
  what an agent working through Bash writes. It now also runs after Bash and
  checks every file git reports changed.
- Left uncaught on purpose: aliased constants, hoisted tuples, dispatch dicts,
  reverse `in`, `operator.eq` and lowercase JS state. Each would flag ordinary
  code in bulk. They are documented as blind spots rather than hidden.
- A file the checker cannot parse is reported as a violation, not skipped.
- Source: `scripts/check_enums.py`; [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).

### D-22 The storage mode is an enum, and each mode owns its labels

- Status: Accepted
- `Mode` (`app/js/00-core/30-state.js`) is a frozen object with `CONNECTING`,
  `LOCAL`, `API` and `ARTIFACT`. What a save tells the user is looked up in
  `SAVED_LABEL`, keyed by `Mode`, rather than chosen by a comparison.
- Why: `MODE` was assigned `"api"` in one file and compared with `"shared"` in
  another, so the server-backed mode reported "Saved in this browser" after every
  save (#55), contradicting the header beside it.
- An unknown mode falls back to a label that claims nothing ("Saved") rather than
  to one that claims the wrong place. Only `LOCAL` may mention the browser, and
  the test asserts it.
- The artifact mode's value changed from `"shared"` to `"artifact"`. Nothing
  outside the app read it.
- The header is the same shape: `MODE_LABEL`, keyed by `Mode`, with a text and a
  CSS class per mode, and a test that every mode has one and no two share a
  text. The artifact mode was labeled "Shared workspace", as the server was
  (#64), and now says "Claude artifact", saves to "this Claude artifact", and
  shows a standing notice. The notice states where the data lives and what the
  comparison in `docs/running.md` says it lacks, and says not to enter
  patient-identifiable information, as the browser-only banner does. That is
  about the artifact mode only: it says nothing about the server mode, whose
  classification is still open (R-21).
- Source: closed issue #55; R-04.

### D-20 Pre-commit is the only CI gate

- Status: **Superseded by D-23**
- `lint.yml` ran `prek` and nothing else, so no test ran on a pull request (#32).
  Kept for the history: until D-23, a property could not honestly be called
  "tested" on the strength of a test file CI never executed.

### D-23 CI runs every test, in four jobs, and a skip fails

- Status: Accepted
- `.github/workflows/test.yml` runs on every pull request and on main:
  **workflows** (unit: `test-workflows`, `test-enums`, and `actionlint`),
  **server** (the API against a PostgreSQL 17 service container), **browser**
  (the dashboard suites in Chromium) and **stack** (the proxy, then the Compose
  stack end to end). A fifth job, **tests passed**, depends on all of them and
  treats a skipped job as a failure, so one check name can gate a merge and a new
  job cannot be forgotten.
- Why three environments: what the server tests exercise IS the database (a row
  lock, a trigger), the dashboard needs a browser, and the identity handoff needs
  a real Caddy. A fake would test the fake.
- Why `REQUIRE_TESTS`: a skip exits 0. On a runner with no database 106 of 201
  server tests skip and the run is green. See R-24.
- Why the CI configuration has unit tests: the gap opened because a test could be
  added and left out of CI. `test_workflows.py` fails if any `pixi run test-*`
  task is not run by CI, if a test file has no task, if Postgres drifts from the
  version `compose.yaml` pins, or if a job loses its timeout. Each rule has a
  mutation test.
- Found by running it: `test_stack.py`'s browser section had been broken since the
  Content-Security-Policy shipped, because `wait_for_function` evaluates a string
  and the policy forbids `unsafe-eval`. It is fixed with a polling helper, which
  keeps the app under the policy it ships with rather than bypassing it.
- Branch protection is on. The owner enabled the `protect-main` ruleset, which
  requires a pull request and the `tests passed` check (pinned to the GitHub
  Actions app, so nothing else can satisfy it by posting a status of the same
  name) and blocks force-pushes and deletion. It has **no bypass actors**, so it
  applies to administrators too. Verified by trying to merge a throwaway PR
  twice, once with the check pending and once with it red; both were refused.
  The first attempt found that the ruleset had been saved with an EMPTY
  required-checks list, which enforced nothing, so verify it rather than
  trusting that it is on.
- It is a repository setting, not a file, so nothing in the repo can detect it
  being switched off (C-48). To check it: `gh api
  repos/OWNER/REPO/rules/branches/main`.
- Actions are pinned by tag, matching the existing workflows; pinning by commit
  SHA is #37.
- Source: #32; R-23, R-24.

### D-24 The server decides who signed a checkpoint, and when

- Status: Accepted
- `server/app/signoff.py` rewrites `gates.*.signedBy` and `signedAt` from the
  caller and the clock on create and on patch, mirroring what `append_log`
  already does for the audit log's `at` and `by`.
- Attribution follows the *decision*, not the claim. Changing a decision without
  sending any attribution would otherwise leave the record saying the previous
  person made the new decision. Setting or changing one attributes it to the
  caller; clearing one clears it; recording a periodic review attributes the
  reviewer.
- An unchanged decision is a **no-op, not an error**. The browser may re-send a
  whole gate, and a 403 would be read by the app as "your access changed" and put
  the user into read-only mode. Forgery is prevented by ignoring the claim, not
  by punishing it.
- Rejected: failing the request when a client sends a wrong `signedBy`. It turns
  an ordinary resend into a visible failure and teaches nothing the caller can
  act on.
- Only `signedBy` and `signedAt` are the server's. `by`, `date` and `rationale`
  are the committee's own words and stay as sent.
- A project created with pre-signed gates (an import) is attributed to whoever
  creates it. They are the one asserting it in this deployment; the original
  signer is not authenticated here and cannot be.
- With identity disabled (`REQUIRE_IDENTITY=false`) nothing is attributed, the
  same carve-out `access.py` makes, and `/api/health` reports it.
- Known limit: nothing signs the attestation cryptographically. The proxy
  identity is the trust anchor for everything here; making the sign-off match it
  is the fix, not raising it above it.
- Source: closed issue #31; R-09.

### D-25 The API assembles the database URL; compose passes the pieces

- Status: Accepted
- `compose.yaml` hands the API `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_PORT`, `POSTGRES_USER`,
  `POSTGRES_DB` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. `build_database_url` in `config.py`
  assembles the URL and percent-encodes every part, so the choice of password is
  irrelevant. An explicit `DATABASE_URL` still wins, for managed instances whose
  URL carries `sslmode` or a Cloud SQL socket the pieces cannot express.
- Why: compose cannot percent-encode. `postgresql://u:${POSTGRES_PASSWORD}@db/..`
  broke on a `/` in the password, which the documented generator produces about
  half the time (measured: 47% of 20,000).
- A hand-written `DATABASE_URL` that cannot be parsed fails at startup with a
  message that names the likely cause and the way out, and **never echoes the
  password**. urllib's own message embeds the offending text, which here is the
  start of the password, and an error that quotes a credential ends up in a log
  aggregator.
- Rejected: telling operators to use `openssl rand -hex`. It shifts the burden to
  every operator and to every password manager, fixes nothing for a password
  chosen by a person, and leaves a first-run path that works only if you happened
  to read the right sentence.
- Rejected: rejecting such passwords in `preflight.py`. Correct passwords would
  be refused to protect a code path that should simply be correct.
- Source: R-25.

### D-26 The walkthrough video is hosted on the docs site, under a bounded cap

- Status: Accepted
- The source recording was 160 MB (2392x1462, 14.5 Mbps), over GitHub's 100 MB
  push limit and the repo's own 512 KB guard. A screen recording compresses
  extremely well: re-encoded to 1920 px wide, H.264, CRF 26, it is **7.5 MB** at
  the same 91 seconds, which also fits GitHub's 10 MB free-plan limit for inline
  video attachments.
- Hosted on the docs site (`docs/assets/`) and played with a plain `<video>`.
  Rejected: YouTube or Vimeo (a third-party iframe, against the spirit of R-05);
  a README drag-and-drop upload (a manual browser step, hosted by GitHub outside
  the repo and not versioned with it); a Release asset (works, but is not shown
  on the project's own page).
- Cost, accepted: about 7.6 MB added to git history, permanently. The repo was
  about 6 MB. Rewriting a public repo's history to remove it later would be worse
  than the cost, so this is the decision to revisit *before* adding a second
  video, not after.
- The repo-wide 512 KB limit is unchanged. Media under `docs/assets/` gets its own
  hook with a 10 MB cap, and `tests/test_docs_media.py` fails if that number and
  the page's assumption ever differ. An exception with a cap is a different thing
  from no limit.
- The poster is the portfolio overview, chosen because it is the most legible
  single frame. The video shows the browser's own chrome (a profile chip and an
  extension button), which is public now.
- Source: R-26.

### D-27 Claims are rows with a quoted sentence and evidence CI runs

- Status: Accepted
- `docs/security-claims.md` has one section per claim: the claim, one or more
  `Asserted in` entries (a file and the sentence **quoted**), a status, the
  evidence, and for anything not fully enforced the gap and its issue.
  `scripts/check_claims.py` verifies it.
- The quote is the key design choice. A claim list that only names tests rots
  silently when the doc is edited. Quoting the sentence means editing the doc
  fails the check until the row is reviewed, which is when "is this still true?"
  gets asked.
- Evidence must be something **CI runs**: a `server/tests` test, a `tests/` suite
  with a pixi task in `test.yml`, or a pre-commit hook. A test nobody runs is
  what #32 was.
- Four statuses, one of them `violated`. A claim the code does not back may stay
  in the inventory, with its issue, so the repository can say "this sentence is
  not true yet" in the open. The alternative, deleting the row or the sentence to
  pass, hides the finding.
- Rejected: scanning the docs for assertive words and requiring a row for each.
  It is noisy, and it would fail on ordinary prose. Finding a claim nobody wrote
  down is a judgment, which is what the CLAUDE.md rule asks of the author.
- The first run found a gap that became a test: the isolation the security model
  rests on had only a manual `make` target. `tests/test_compose_isolation.py` now
  asserts it against the real `compose.yaml` in CI. It also found that
  `preflight.py` has no tests (#77).
- Source: #68; R-19.

### D-28 Preflight reads `.env` exactly as compose does

- Status: Accepted
- `scripts/preflight.py` decides from `.env` alone, so the way for it to be wrong
  is to read `.env` differently from compose, and both mistakes failed open:
  an empty `SITE_ADDRESS=` (compose: the default, plain `http://:80`) was read as
  "not plain HTTP" and passed a bind to the whole network, and
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD=abc # a long note` was counted at the length of the note while
  compose used `abc`.
- So it follows compose's rules: an empty value is the default (`${VAR:-d}`), an
  unquoted `#` after whitespace starts a comment, a quoted value keeps its `#`,
  and `export` is accepted. Its two defaults are constants, and a test fails if
  they drift from `compose.yaml`.
- Found by writing the tests (#77), not by reading the code: the gate had never
  been tested, and a gate nobody tests is a claim.
- Rejected: shelling out to `docker compose config` to read the resolved values.
  It would be exact, but it needs Docker and the variables set, and preflight must
  run first, before anything is up, on a machine that may have neither.
- Source: #77; R-08.

### D-30 One variable turns on the shared secret at both ends

- Status: Accepted
- `compose.yaml` hands `PROXY_SHARED_SECRET` to both the `api` and the `proxy`
  service, and `proxy/Caddyfile` sends it as `X-Proxy-Secret` with `header_up`.
  Setting it once in `.env` therefore turns the control on at both ends; unset,
  the API does not check and the proxy sends an empty value.
- Why: the API half existed (`_check_shared_secret`) and nothing sent the header,
  so the documented way to enable the control made every request 403 (#61). Two
  settings that must agree are one setting too many.
- `header_up` sets the header, which replaces a value the client sent under the
  same name. Do not add `header_up -X-Proxy-Secret` beside it: Caddy applies
  deletes after sets and the secret would vanish.
- It authenticates the proxy to the API. It is not a way for a caller to
  authenticate to the proxy, which the deployment guide used to suggest.
- The header name is fixed at the API's default, `X-Proxy-Secret`. Compose does
  not pass `PROXY_SECRET_HEADER`, so the two cannot disagree.
- Rejected: documenting it as an operator exercise (set it on the API, add a
  `header_up` to a Caddyfile you edit). That is the configuration nobody tested.
- Source: #61; R-07, D-04.

### D-31 `check-isolation` is a script with an exit code, not shell that prints

- Status: Accepted
- `make check-isolation` runs `scripts/check_isolation.py`. It asserts three things
  and exits non-zero on any failure: no host port on `api` or `db`, a refused
  direct connection to the API, and a forged `X-Auth-Request-*` that does not
  come back as the identity. The third tests for the forged value's absence,
  because the legitimate identity varies by deployment. Not running the stack
  is a failure, not a pass.
- Why: the shell version printed what it found and ended step 3 with `|| true`,
  so it exited 0 whatever it saw (#56). The docs told operators to put it in
  post-deploy automation, where the exit code is the only thing read.
- Why a script: so each decision is a function a test can break
  (`tests/test_check_isolation.py`), and so CI can run it against the real
  stack (`tests/test_stack.py`). A Makefile target is not evidence CI counts
  (R-19).
- Rejected: fixing the shell in place. It would be correct once and untestable
  after.
- Source: #56; R-07, R-19.

### D-32 The root `.dockerignore` is an allowlist

- Status: Accepted
- It excludes everything (`*`) and admits `proxy/Caddyfile` and `docs/app/`,
  the only paths `proxy/Dockerfile` COPYs.
- Why an allowlist: the context is the whole repository, which holds a
  password file, encrypted and plaintext backups, the git history and a
  licensed PDF. A blocklist guards against the secrets somebody thought of; an
  allowlist guards against the next file nobody did.
- Rejected: narrowing the context so the Dockerfile does not need the root
  (build the dashboard into `proxy/` first). It changes the documented build
  command to save a two-line file.
- Rejected: a CI check that a built image contains no `.env`. The image was
  never the problem; the context is, and that is what is tested.
- Source: #63; R-29.

### D-33 The backup passphrase goes through the environment and a mode-600 file

- Status: Accepted
- `scripts/backup_crypto.sh` takes `BACKUP_PASSPHRASE` from the environment,
  writes it with the shell builtin `printf` to a `mktemp` file created under
  `umask 077`, passes gpg `--passphrase-file`, and removes the file in a trap.
- Why: argv is world-readable on Linux, so `gpg --passphrase "$PW"` showed every
  local account the key to every record for as long as the dump ran (#41). Make
  made it worse: `$(VAR)` is pasted into the recipe text, which is the argv of
  `sh -c`, so even a line that never mentions gpg leaked it.
- Rejected: `--passphrase-fd 0` (stdin is already the dump stream in both
  directions); `--passphrase-fd 3` with a here-string (bash only, and the
  Makefile's recipes should not need to be); a gpg-agent or keyring (right for
  interactive use, awkward for a scripted restore).
- The Makefile runs under bash with `pipefail`, and `backup` chains with `&&`.
  Found while testing this: a failed `pg_dump` left an empty "encrypted" file and
  exited 0, and a restore with the wrong passphrase exited 0 having restored
  nothing, because a pipeline's status is its last command's.
- `scripts/doctor.py` gives docker `-e PGPASSWORD` (the name) and passes the value
  in the environment, for the same reason.
- Source: #41; R-13.

### D-34 The identity prefix is stripped once, and the template cannot undo it

- Status: Accepted
- `_normalized()` in `server/app/auth.py` strips `IDENTITY_STRIP_PREFIX` from the
  id, name and email after the plain and JWT parsers, so they cannot diverge.
  Preflight refuses an identity source that reads `X-Goog-Authenticated-User-*`
  unless the prefix is exactly `accounts.google.com:`. The template's bottom
  `IDENTITY_STRIP_PREFIX=` line is commented out, because compose takes the last
  value in a file and the active line re-emptied what the Google block set.
- Why both: the API fix makes the two paths agree, but only if the prefix is
  configured, and compose passes it through empty. The preflight rule stops the
  misconfiguration before any data is written (#35).
- Rejected: defaulting the prefix to Google's in `compose.yaml`. It would strip
  for every other front door too, silently rewriting ids that merely begin with
  that text.
- Rejected, for now: a `make doctor` check that finds stored ids not matching the
  running configuration. The documented count and repair SQL cover deployments
  that already did this; the check is a follow-up.
- Source: #35; R-30.

### D-35 The proxy runs as uid 65532, with a one-shot job to own its volumes

- Status: Accepted
- `user: 65532:65532`, `cap_drop: ALL` plus `NET_BIND_SERVICE`, `read_only`, a
  tmpfs `/tmp`, and a `proxy-perms` service that `chown -R`s `/data` and `/config`
  before the proxy starts.
- Found by running it, not by reading: the stock `caddy` binary has a file
  capability, so under `cap_drop: ALL` the kernel refuses to exec it ("operation
  not permitted") until `NET_BIND_SERVICE` is back in the bounding set, even
  though Docker lets any user bind port 80. Named volumes are root-owned, so a
  non-root Caddy logged `permission denied` on its autosave, instance id and
  locks, and an automatic-HTTPS deployment would have re-issued certificates on
  every restart.
- The upgrade case is the reason the fixer is recursive and has
  `DAC_READ_SEARCH`: volumes an earlier root-run proxy populated hold `0700`
  directories and `0600` keys. Tested with Caddy's local CA: the non-root proxy
  took over such a volume, served HTTPS, logged no permission error and reused
  the certificate.
- Rejected: leaving the proxy root with fewer capabilities. It works, and is
  the smaller change, but a container escape from the one internet-facing
  process would start as root, which is the finding.
- Rejected: `tmpfs` for `/data`. It runs, and loses the certificates.
- Rejected: baking a `chown` into a compose-built image. Compose bind-mounts the
  Caddyfile and dashboard so an edit needs no rebuild (D-15), and only the cloud
  image is built; there the `chown` is in `proxy/Dockerfile`.
- Limits are defaults, overridable through `.env`, sized for kilobytes of
  documents.

### D-36 Paging by header cursor, over the existing index, with a fixed cap

- Status: Accepted
- The response stays a bare JSON array, so the browser's `ApiStore` and any
  existing caller keep working. The total and the next cursor travel in headers
  (`X-Log-Total`, `X-Log-Next`).
- The cursor is `(at, seq)` as `<microseconds>.<seq>`. `project_log_project_at_idx
  (project_id, at DESC, seq DESC)` already serves `(at, seq) < ($2, $3)` exactly,
  and `seq` breaks ties so nothing repeats or vanishes.
- It is not an ISO timestamp. That first version carried `+` and `:`, a query
  string turns `+` into a space, and a client that forgot to encode it failed in
  a way that looked like corruption. Found by the test.
- `limit` is capped at 500 so no request makes the server build an unbounded
  list. The dashboard's *Show older entries* deepens one request (`?limit=120`,
  `180`, ...) rather than holding a cursor, because every change event refetches
  the newest page and would otherwise discard older pages already loaded.
- Rejected: changing the body to `{entries, total, next}`. Cleaner, and breaks
  every caller for no gain over headers.
- Rejected: `OFFSET`. It re-reads and discards all earlier rows on every page, and
  entries written between pages shift it.
- Source: #40; R-34.

### D-37 Two roles, with the owner's credential in a one-shot job

- Status: Accepted
- `python -m app.migrate` (compose's `migrate` service) holds the owner's
  credential, applies migrations and creates the restricted role; the API gets only
  the restricted role's. `APP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD` is required by `make up` and must
  differ from the owner's.
- Why a separate job and not "migrate at boot, then switch roles": a process that
  starts with the owner's credential still has it in its environment and memory.
  The compromise being defended against is exactly an attacker in the API
  process.
- Why not derive the restricted password from the owner's (an HMAC), which would
  need no new setting: the API would have to be given the owner's password to
  compute it, which is the thing being removed.
- Why `GRANTS` is explicit and nothing is inherited: a new table must name what
  the API may do to it. A test fails if one does not. `project_log` gets UPDATE
  (the purge redacts in place; its trigger permits only that) and no DELETE,
  because a project's log is removed by `ON DELETE CASCADE`, which runs with the
  table owner's rights.
- Found by running the whole suite as the restricted role: four tests exercised
  the triggers by issuing statements the restricted role is now refused earlier,
  by a privilege check. They connect as the owner, since the triggers bind the
  owner too; `test_roles.py` covers the role being refused.
- Rejected: row-level security or moving the merge into the database (the
  issue's own non-goals).
- Rejected: leaving it to the operator to grant by hand. That is the configuration
  nobody tests.
- Source: #48; R-35.

### D-38 A principals table, resolved only for people you can already see

- Status: Accepted
- The proxy asserts name and email on every request and the API discarded them.
  `principals` keeps them keyed by id, upserted as people sign in, throttled in
  memory (new, changed, or at most hourly) so a read is not a write. This is the
  issue's option 1.
- The lookup is not open. A signed-in user could otherwise walk a directory of
  every member of staff who ever signed in, so it answers for the caller and for
  people on a project the caller can read, and omits the rest. Omitted, not 403:
  an absent id carries no information about whether the person exists.
- The server-backed mode shows the id when it cannot name someone (the issue's
  option 4, as the fallback): it is what a reviewer can match against a
  directory, where "someone" tells them nothing. The artifact and browser-only
  modes keep "someone".
- Rejected: resolving against the IdP (Graph, Google Directory). More correct and
  a new outbound dependency and credential for a hospital to approve.
- Rejected: a display name typed when granting access. It drifts, and does not help
  ids that predate it.
- Cost, stated: a staff directory exists as a side effect. It is documented as
  personal data in `docs/deploy.md`, and erasing one person from it is not yet a
  supported operation (#57).
- Source: #39; R-36.

### D-39 Break-glass is an identity flag, with an unmissable record of each use

- Status: Accepted
- `Identity.emergency` is set from configuration and the proxy's asserted id
  alone. `access.require()` returns True when a request was allowed only because
  of it, and the route then records the use. The access lists are unchanged: the
  break-glass identity does not appear in them and cannot be removed from a
  project by one.
- Why record in the project's own log, as a system entry: the people who need to
  know are the project's owners, and the log is where they look; a system entry
  (`is_system`) is never redacted by a purge, so the evidence survives the very
  operation an emergency user might run. A separately-named event
  (`access.breakglass`) and a dedicated logger make it alertable.
- Why reads are throttled and writes are not: a dashboard refetches the log and
  versions on every change event, so an unthrottled read entry would write hundreds
  of rows per hour for one open tab. One per person per project per ten minutes
  still says it happened and who. Every use, throttled or not, is an
  `access.breakglass` security event. Revisit if a stricter reading of "every
  use" is wanted.
- Known limit: a delete's log entry goes with the project (by design, D-10/R-11).
  The warning and the tombstone remain. SSE streams are not widened: a break-glass
  identity is not in a project's audience, so it fetches rather than being pushed.
- Rejected: a role hierarchy or organization admin (the issue's own non-goal).
- Rejected: an `UPDATE` run by hand against the database. That is the privileged
  path the role model exists to avoid, and it leaves no record in the application.
- Source: #42; R-37.

### D-40 Bound the stream's life; do not build a session layer

- Status: Accepted
- The API stays free of sessions (D-03): identity comes from the proxy. The one
  place a revoked identity kept working was the event stream, which
  authenticates at attach. The API cannot re-ask the identity provider, so the
  fix is to **end the stream** on a timer and let the browser's reconnect do the
  re-authentication, which is exactly what the front door is for. This is the
  issue's option 2, adapted: it said to re-check the identity on the keepalive
  tick, and there is nothing in the API to check it against.
- The idle lock is a screen lock, off by default. It reloads rather than
  re-authenticating in place, because only the front door can authenticate. It
  flushes pending edits first.
- `SIGN_OUT_URL` is an allowlist (https, or a single-slash path), applied by the
  server at startup and again in the browser, because the server's answer is
  data and the value becomes a link. `javascript:`, `data:`, plain `http:` and
  `//host` are refused.
- Found while writing it: `ApiStore` set `es.onerror = () => {}`, so a stream
  that was closed for good (what a refused reconnect looks like) was swallowed
  and the page went on looking live. It now reports `stream_closed`.
- Rejected: building sign-in or a session in the API (the issue's own non-goal).
- Rejected, for now: closing the stream when the identity's *access* to a
  project changes. Events are already filtered by the audience at publish time.
- Source: #49; R-38.

### D-41 One security-event stream, JSON, tagged, and not the application log

- Status: Accepted
- `emit(SecurityEvent.X, message, **fields)` writes through a dedicated
  `chai.security` logger. The JSON formatter tags every line with its `stream`
  (`security` or `app`) so a sink can route and retain them separately (the
  issue's option 4) and an alert is a field match (option 1). The human-readable
  message is kept, so `LOG_FORMAT=text` and existing tests still read naturally.
- The security logger is held at INFO regardless of `LOG_LEVEL`, because an
  event that disappears when someone turns the application log down is not an
  audit.
- Values are `json.dumps`ed, so an identity with a quote or newline stays in its
  own string. Tokens and secrets are never fields: a token that cannot be
  decoded logs only the exception's class.
- The rate-limit event is once per client per window, or a flood of refused
  requests would become a flood of log lines, which is the denial of service
  again.
- It replaced the per-module loggers `chai.access` and `chai.emergency`, which
  could not be filtered together and whose names were in the docs as the thing
  to alert on. Those references now point at the events.
- Found while testing: `configure_logging` took a string and compared it to the
  enum by identity, so passing `"json"` silently selected the text format. It
  now coerces at its boundary (`LogFormat(fmt)`), which also rejects an unknown
  value.
- Rejected: a log shipper in the stack. A hospital has its own collector, and
  one more container that holds the security stream is one more thing to harden.
- Rejected: an audit table for these (option 3 of #33 is the read trail, which
  is a different thing). A database admin can alter a table; a sink outside the
  database is the tamper-evident copy. Both are in #33.
- Source: #38; R-39.

### D-42 A table and the security stream, in the transaction of the read

- Status: Accepted
- Both of the issue's recorded options: an append-only `access_event` table,
  written in the same transaction as the read (option 1), and the same fact as a
  named security event (option 2), which is the copy outside the database that
  an administrator cannot alter. Option 3.
- A list is one row carrying the ids it returned, not one row per project: the
  dashboard refetches the list on every change event, and a row per project
  would multiply that. The ids are in `detail`, so "did account X open project
  P" is still answerable.
- Fail closed: the insert is part of the transaction, so a read that cannot be
  recorded is a 500. An availability cost, taken on purpose: an audit control
  that silently stops recording is the failure this exists to prevent.
- Nothing is recorded for a refused request or a missing project. Nothing was
  disclosed; the refusal is `access.denied`.
- `source_ip` is `X-Real-IP` (the proxy's `{remote_host}`), else the peer. It is
  for correlation and the docs say so; nothing authorizes on it (D-05).
- Exports cannot be controlled, only recorded, because they happen in the
  browser. Rejected: moving export generation to the server. It would make the
  beacon a real control, and break the single-file, no-server dashboard (R-01)
  for every other mode.
- Rejected: an `UPDATE`-able table, or a foreign key to `projects`: the trail
  must outlive the record it describes (D-10).
- Source: #33; R-40.

### D-43 Verify a backup by restoring it into a throwaway container

- Status: Accepted
- The check is "does this dump restore into the database I run, and does it keep
  what it is for". So the throwaway is the production major version, read from
  `compose.yaml` so the test cannot drift from what runs, and the checks are the
  tables, the rows and the append-only triggers (a restore that drops them
  silently loses the guarantee, so a clean `psql` exit is not enough).
- Isolation: no network, data on tmpfs, a memory cap, a random name, removed in
  a `finally`. Nothing touches the live database; it needs no running stack.
- Each pipeline stage's exit status is read, because a pipeline's status is its
  last command's and a failed decrypt used to look like a successful restore
  (D-33).
- It cannot tell that a dump is recent or that an off-host copy is the same
  file: it checks the file it is given. The docs say so, and that the time it
  takes is the restore time to record.
- Rejected: restoring into the live stack's `db` service. A verification must
  not be able to damage production.
- Rejected: shipping a scheduler or an off-host uploader. Where backups run and
  land is the operator's decision; the gap was that nothing said it was one.
- Source: #52; R-41.

### D-44 Ask once, on the record, for something that cannot be checked

- Status: Accepted
- Encryption at rest of the host's disk cannot be verified from inside a
  container, so preflight does not pretend to: it refuses a production-shaped
  stack until the operator asserts it with a deliberately specific value (`=1`,
  not `true` or `yes`), in the spirit of the dev-auth acknowledgment. That turns
  "nobody thought about it" into "someone decided", which is what an addressable
  specification asks for.
- "Production-shaped" is a non-loopback bind using the stack's own volume. A
  laptop on loopback is not asked, and a managed database is the provider's
  storage.
- `make doctor` reports what the host shows (a `crypt` layer under the device)
  and says "cannot tell" when it cannot; the cloud provider may encrypt below
  that.
- Rejected: pretending to detect it. A check that sometimes reports "encrypted"
  from incomplete information is worse than none.
- Rejected: column- or document-level encryption (the issue's own non-goal).
- A non-loopback bind is also what the plain-HTTP rule keys on (D-28), so the
  two share one definition of loopback (`LOOPBACK_HOSTS`).
- Source: #47; R-42.

### D-45 Lock with hashes, pin by digest, scan what we build

- Status: Accepted
- The lock is `server/requirements.txt` (pip-compile, `--generate-hashes`,
  resolved in the image's own Python) and the project itself is **not**
  pip-installed: installing it would resolve build dependencies from PyPI, an
  unpinned step in a pinned build, and the runtime already sets
  `PYTHONPATH=/app`. The file is named `requirements.txt` so Dependabot's pip
  ecosystem updates it directly.
- Found by scanning rather than by reading: four HIGH findings in the API image
  were not our dependencies. They were libraries **vendored inside pip**, which
  shipped in the runtime venv where nothing uses it. Removing pip removed them.
  The same scan found 22 in the official `postgres:17` image's `gosu`, which we
  cannot patch.
- So the scan gate covers what we build (`--ignore-unfixed`, fail), and the
  official images are reported without failing: a CVE in someone else's image
  must not turn every unrelated pull request red. It is not part of `tests
  passed` for the same reason, but runs on every pull request so a finding is
  visible.
- Actions by SHA with the tag in a comment, which Dependabot understands. Trivy
  via its action, so Dependabot maintains it, rather than a floating `docker
  run`.
- `chai-updates.yml` pushed straight to `main`, which has been protected since
  D-23, so that step could no longer succeed. It now pushes a branch and opens a
  pull request, and dispatches `test.yml` on it, because a pull request opened
  with `GITHUB_TOKEN` does not start workflows and the required check would
  otherwise never appear. This has not run in Actions yet: the next scheduled or
  manual run is its first.
- The SLA in `SECURITY.md` is a set of **targets** the owner should confirm;
  they are a policy, and are mine only as a first draft. (Superseded by D-58:
  the owner declined them.)
- Rejected: signing and attestation (the issue's own non-goal); a `docker run`
  of Trivy by a floating tag; failing every pull request on third-party image
  findings.
- Source: #37; R-43.

### D-46 Report size, alert on the disk, do not guess a threshold

- Status: Accepted
- `make doctor` prints numbers and what they mean, and no pass/fail line. A
  fixed threshold would be wrong on every disk but the one it was written for,
  and a threshold that is sometimes wrong is a warning people learn to ignore.
  The control is an alert on the disk, which the docs say how to set per
  platform.
- The read trail (D-42) is included because a row per list is written on every
  change event for every viewer, which is the fastest-growing source in a busy
  deployment. I measured about 560 bytes a row at 12 projects, growing with the
  project count because a list stores the ids it returned.
- Rejected: coalescing rapid revisions (the issue's option 3). It changes the
  "one row per revision" invariant the history's value rests on, for a saving
  the disk alert already makes survivable.
- Rejected, for now: a retention policy with a disposal path (option 4). It
  needs the retention period decided first (#57).
- Source: #54; R-44.

### D-47 Leave the region to the reader and say it is their decision

- Status: Accepted
- Examples take the region from a variable the reader must fill in. A copied
  command with `<your-region>` left in fails loudly, which is the point: a
  default that works is a default that was never chosen.
- The residency section lists example EU regions and names what else can move
  data out of a region, and stops there. Whether a transfer mechanism is needed
  is a legal question this project does not answer.
- Rejected: swapping the US defaults for EU ones (it only moves the unmade
  decision); a region per provider table of "compliant" regions (a legal claim
  nobody here can back); a script that checks the region (the guide is prose
  and the resources are in the reader's account).
- Source: #58; R-45.

### D-48 State the position and ship the finder; do not invent a retention period

- Status: Accepted
- The floor the issue named is writing the position down and a way to find one
  person's data. Both are done. The retention period is not: it is an owner
  decision with legal weight (R-47, Open), so the page says it is undecided
  rather than inventing six years or any other number.
- The finder is SQL run through `psql` in the database container, like `doctor`,
  with the subject passed as a psql variable so it is quoted, never spliced. It
  reports locations and counts, not contents, so the tool does not itself produce
  a copy of staff data that someone must then protect.
- A test asks the database for every column named `*_by`, `by_id` or `actor` and
  fails if the query does not mention it. It already caught one the first draft
  missed (`project_log.purged_by`).
- Rejected: pseudonymizing staff identifiers (a significant redesign, worth it
  only if erasure requests are real); a DSR workflow in the app (the issue's own
  non-goal); a post-restore step that re-applies purges (needs a place for the
  list of purges that survives a restore, #116).
- Source: #57; R-46, R-47.

### D-49 Provenance comes from the same table as the header

- Status: Accepted
- The export text is built from `MODE_LABEL` and a sibling `MODE_PROVENANCE`, both
  keyed by `Mode`, so a new mode cannot ship without wording and the export cannot
  drift from what the header says. The JSON gets a `storage` object with the enum
  value, so a script reads the mode and never parses prose.
- The portfolio CSV gets a trailing "Stored in" column, not a comment row, so a
  spreadsheet's sort and filter still work. An empty portfolio exports no row to
  carry it; that is the one case it is silent.
- Rejected: a watermark on the PDF only (the HTML and Markdown are filed too);
  stating that a mode is "approved" or "safe" (R-21 is open, and it is a legal call).
- Source: #93; R-48.

### D-50 State the scope in every mode; do not build a detector to back it, yet

- Status: Accepted
- The owner chose option 1 on #34 over option 3 (state the policy and build a
  detector as the safeguard). The scope is the same in every mode, so one
  constant (`SCOPE_NOTICE`) is rendered by each mode's notice, and the server
  mode, which had none, gets one.
- The wording is an instruction ("never enter"), not an assurance ("contains no
  patient data"), because nothing checks the free-text fields. A mistake is
  corrected by an owner's purge, which the server notice names.
- The HIPAA Security Rule citations in `docs/deploy.md` (encryption at rest,
  backups, emergency access) were written while the scope was open. With no
  ePHI in scope they describe good practice the controls follow, not a legal
  requirement on this system; rewording them is a follow-up, not part of this.
- Rejected: option 2 (PHI in scope; a BAA and required standards) and option 3
  (a detector as the safeguard), by the owner's decision. PHI detection (R-22)
  stays open.
- Source: the owner, on #34; R-49.

### D-51 Scan for labeled identifiers on demand; no model, no sidecar

- Status: Accepted
- The owner's decision. With patient data out of scope (R-49), what is wanted is
  a way to notice a mistake, not a control that makes patient data acceptable.
  Rules catch the shapes a paste leaves (an SSN, a labeled MRN or date of birth)
  with almost no false alarms; a model catches names and dates, which a
  governance record is full of, and would flag nearly every record.
- The scan reads through the database container like `make subject-access`, so
  it covers revisions and audit entries a live read cannot reach. Purged content
  is skipped: it is already destroyed.
- It never prints the matched text, because a report that quotes it is a second
  copy in a terminal or a ticket. Location, kind and the revisions are enough to
  find it.
- The false-positive rate was measured on this corpus: the dashboard's ten
  sample projects, 1,365 strings, produce no match, and a test keeps it so.
- Rejected: the OpenMed sidecar (#65) and Croissant de-identification (#67), by
  the owner's decision; surfacing the scan in `make doctor` (a scan of every
  revision is not a quick health check).
- Supersedes: D-21.
- Source: the owner; #66; R-50.

### D-52 Keep the citations, change what they claim

- Status: Accepted
- The HIPAA Security Rule standards stay cited, because they are the vocabulary
  a hospital security team reviews against and they explain why each control
  exists. What changed is the claim: "follows the practice of", not "is
  required". The one sentence that tied encryption to a PHI breach rule (45 CFR
  164.402) is gone from the docs and from `make preflight`'s refusal, which now
  names what a lost disk does expose: the review records and staff data.
- Code comments and test docstrings that cite a standard as the reason a control
  exists are left as they are: they explain intent, and they are not read as a
  statement to a deployer.
- Rejected: removing the citations (it would hide why a control exists);
  weakening a control because the rule no longer binds (the sign-off record and
  staff data still need it).
- Source: #121; R-49, R-51.

### D-53 Search the text the browser already holds; no search endpoint

- Status: Accepted
- The owner asked for a dashboard search that finds every project containing
  some text and links to it (#57). It runs over the projects the browser has
  already loaded, which are exactly the ones the viewer may open, so it adds no
  read path, needs no new server route or read-trail action (R-40), and works
  the same in all three storage modes.
- A name also searches the ids it belongs to, because the lists that matter for
  a subject access request (access, sign-offs, last changed by) hold ids.
- The cost is coverage: only current versions. Earlier revisions and the audit
  log are server-side and reachable with `make subject-access`; the UI says so
  rather than implying the search is complete.
- Rejected: a server-side full-text endpoint over history (a new read path over
  every revision, with its own access rules and read-trail rows, for a need the
  administrator command already meets).
- Source: the owner, on #57; R-46.

### D-54 Pseudonymizing staff identifiers is deferred

- Status: Accepted
- The owner's decision on #57's option 3, 2026-10-08. Storing opaque ids and
  breaking the mapping on erasure would leave every existing revision and log
  entry holding real ids, because they are append-only (R-10), unless history
  were rewritten under an exception to it. Names typed into free-text fields
  would survive either way. The issue's own condition for doing it, erasure
  requests expected to be real, has not been met.
- Erasure stays as `docs/privacy.md` states it: content can be purged, and the
  fact of who did what is kept.
- Revisit if erasure requests become real.
- Source: the owner, on #57; R-10, R-46.

### D-55 The purge ledger lives outside the dump: the live database, then the log

- Status: Accepted
- A purge is recorded in the rows it changes, which is exactly what an older dump
  overwrites. So the ledger has to come from somewhere the dump does not: the live
  database just before the restore (the ordinary case), or the security log, which
  is shipped off the host (the case where the database is what was lost).
- A purge empties every revision of one incarnation and redacts every entry of
  the project's log, so one ledger line is enough: project, incarnation, moment,
  person, and the last revision and entry reached. Re-applying matches on those,
  and on time, because a restored sequence can reuse a number.
- The re-apply is the same transition the purge made, so the append-only
  triggers (R-10, R-12) allow it unchanged; nothing is relaxed for it. It runs as
  the owner, as `make restore` already does.
- The ledger names who purged what, so it is written mode 600 into `backups/`.
- Rejected: a ledger written at backup time (it holds only purges older than the
  newest dump, which a restore of that dump already has); re-applying from the
  restored database itself (the purge is what the old dump lacks).
- Source: #116, #57; R-53.

### D-56 Count from retirement, and defer to the organization's schedule

- Status: Accepted
- The owner accepted the recommended periods (R-54). The governance record's
  clock starts when the AI solution is retired, because the record's job is to
  show who reviewed a tool still in use. Six years follows the HIPAA Security
  Rule's documentation period, the figure hospital compliance teams already work
  to, and covers most malpractice limitation periods.
- The read trail and the security log defer to the organization's existing
  audit-log and security-log policies, which already exist and are set by the
  people who answer for them.
- Recorded as documentation first. Automatic disposal is a separate decision,
  because it is the first scheduled deletion from append-only tables (R-10).
- Rejected: a period counted from creation (it could delete the sign-off of a
  tool still in use); a single period for every table (the read trail and logs
  have their own owners and policies).
- Source: the owner, on #57; R-54.

### D-57 The confusable-character check is removed

- Status: Accepted
- The owner's instruction, 2026-10-08. `scripts/check_homographs.py` failed any
  file holding Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian or fullwidth characters, because one
  link once spelled a word with a Cyrillic "o". The dashboard is gaining
  translations (#80), and a Simplified Chinese catalog uses fullwidth
  punctuation as a matter of course, so the check would have blocked the
  languages the owner chose. It also had no tests of its own.
- What it caught is no longer checked anywhere: a lookalike letter in a URL or
  an identifier in the docs or code.
- Source: the owner; #80.

### D-58 The security policy promises no response or fix times

- Status: Accepted
- The owner's decision, 2026-10-08: the project has one developer and cannot
  commit to the targets D-45 drafted (acknowledge in 5 business days, fix a
  critical in 14). A target a reporter or a hospital reads is a commitment,
  whatever it is called, so the policy states none. It keeps how to report
  privately, that remediation goes in order of severity, what is in scope, and
  that a deployment needing a response commitment must get it from whoever
  operates it.
- Supersedes the SLA bullet of D-45 (the rest of D-45 stands).
- Source: the owner.

### D-59 Embedded catalogs, English warnings until reviewed, and a ratchet

- Status: Accepted; its "exports stay English" and its rejection of translating
  the framework content are superseded by D-60
- Languages and defaults are the owner's (R-55): the six languages plus Russian,
  Simplified Chinese for Mandarin, a per-browser choice, machine-drafted
  translations, and safety-bearing text in English until reviewed.
- Catalogs are JSON files the build embeds as one frozen object, because the
  dashboard is one file that must work from disk and as an artifact (R-01).
  `t()` returns text and callers escape it; a catalog never holds HTML, so a
  translation cannot inject markup. `tHtml()` places markup the caller built.
- Plurals use the browser's `Intl.PluralRules`; the checker's table of the
  forms each language needs is tested against it, so neither can drift.
- The English text of a mode stays in `MODE_LABEL` for exports, and the header
  uses a catalog key: exports are a record and stay stable.
- Converting every screen at once was not done. A pseudo-locale counts the text
  still hard-coded on three screens, and the baseline may only shrink, like the
  enum ratchet (D-19).
- The spelling check skips catalogs other than `en.json`, because a word that is
  British in English can be correct in another language (German, French).
- Rejected: fetching catalogs at run time (breaks R-01); an i18n library (R-05,
  and size); translating the framework content now (third-party text with
  attribution terms, its own plan).
- Source: the owner, on #80; R-55.

### D-60 Reports follow the reader; framework content is translated, marked

- Status: Accepted
- The owner's decision, 2026-10-08, on both open parts of #80.
- **Exports.** The HTML, PDF and Markdown reports are written in the reader's
  language and name it (`<html lang>`, a "Language" line). The JSON and CSV
  exports stay English: scripts and the Croissant exporter read their keys and
  values. The provenance note and the report footers are safety-bearing, so
  they stay English in a report until a reviewer is recorded, like on screen.
- **Framework content.** The CHAI criteria, stages, checkpoints, model card
  fields and metric categories, the OPTICA questions, and the CHAI metric names
  are translated, machine-drafted, with a note on each translated framework
  screen that the wording is an unofficial translation. The CHAI metric text is
  CC BY 4.0, which permits translation with attribution and an indication of
  changes, and the note says it was translated. Values a record stores (a
  checkpoint decision, a metric category, a metric's name) stay English, so a
  record does not change with the language of whoever filled it in.
- Rejected: a per-export language choice (a second control for the same thing);
  leaving framework content English (a translated interface around English
  criteria is the hardest of both worlds to read).
- Supersedes: D-59's "exports stay English" and its rejection of translating
  the framework content.
- Source: the owner, on #80; R-55.

### D-61 The documentation site stays in English

- Status: Accepted
- The owner's decision, 2026-10-08, on #80. The nine pages under `docs/` are
  written for the people who deploy and run the software, and stay English. Only
  the dashboard and its reports are translated (R-55, D-60).
- Rejected: translating the docs (nine pages that change with the code, for a
  readership that already works in English, at the cost of keeping seven copies
  true).
- Source: the owner, on #80.

### D-62 Disposal is a purge, run by an operator, stopped by a hold

- Status: Accepted
- The owner's choices, 2026-10-08, on #57, each the recommended option:
    - disposal reuses the purge, so a tombstone stays (R-12); only the read
      trail loses rows outright;
    - it reports first and applies on request (`make dispose`, `APPLY=1`),
      scheduled by the organization, not by the server;
    - a hold is per project, placed and lifted with a reason, and append-only.
- Built in SQL (`008_retention.sql`), not in the API: the database enforces it
  whoever is connected, the API's role is refused it, and the read trail's
  trigger checks the period itself, so even the owner cannot delete a row too
  young without first changing the recorded policy.
- The periods live in a one-row `retention_policy` table rather than in the
  code, because R-54 makes the organization's schedule take precedence. A
  change is stamped with who and when.
- The clock is the later of the retirement date and the last change, so a
  typo'd or future date, or a later edit, keeps a record longer, never shorter.
- An owner of a project places and lifts a hold on its setup page, or through
  `POST /api/projects/{id}/hold` with a reason. The reason stays with the hold
  and is shown only to owners; the project's history says only that a hold was
  placed or lifted, and the security log names who, not why.
- Disposal of `principals` was added after, by D-64.
- Rejected: deleting every row (leaves no evidence the record existed, against
  R-12); a timer in the server (a wrong date or setting deletes with nobody
  looking); one global hold switch (one dispute would freeze every project).
- Source: the owner, on #57; R-56.

### D-63 Right to left by logical properties and isolated user text

- Status: Accepted
- The owner added Hebrew on 2026-10-08, on #80, the first language written right
  to left; the proposal had asked for this to be decided before it was a
  retrofit.
- **The layout mirrors itself.** `<html dir>` follows the language
  (`localeDir()`), and the stylesheet uses logical properties
  (`margin-inline-start`, `text-align:start`, `inset-inline-start`, the
  `border-start-end-radius` family); the inset accent shadows read a `--dir`
  variable. `check-i18n` refuses a physical left or right, an uneven
  four-value `margin`/`padding`/`border-radius`, or a one-sided inset shadow,
  in the stylesheet or a script's inline style; `rtl-ok: <reason>` excuses one
  that is symmetric or off screen.
- **Text keeps its own direction.** What a person typed is shown through
  `bdi()`, a `<bdi>` that takes its direction from its own text, and fields use
  `unicode-bidi:plaintext`. English that `t()` shows in place of a translation
  (an unreviewed warning, a missing key) is wrapped in a left-to-right isolate
  in a right-to-left page. Without these, an English name in a Hebrew page
  shows its period at the wrong end.
- Rejected: detecting every paragraph's direction from its first strong
  character (Hebrew strings that begin with "CHAI", "MD5" or "OPTICA" would be
  laid out left to right); a separate right-to-left stylesheet (two layouts to
  keep in step).
- The pseudo-locale probe skips `<bdi>`, since it holds data, not interface
  text; the counts it reported had been mostly data.
- Source: the owner, on #80; R-55.

### D-64 A person's name goes when nothing retained names them

- Status: Accepted
- Applies the owner's period for staff names and emails (R-54): "while active,
  then as long as a retained record refers to them". There is no offboarding
  signal, so "no longer active" is read as "not signed in for the read-trail
  period", and "refers to them" as any mention of their id or email, matched as
  a case-insensitive substring, in any column that records who did something or
  inside any document, log entry, read detail or hold reason
  (`principal_referenced()`, `009_principal_disposal.sql`).
- Both readings err toward keeping: a prefix match keeps both people, and a
  purge keeps a revision's author (R-12), so whoever changed a retained record
  stays listed as long as it does.
- It runs inside `dispose_due()`, after the read trail, so a person known only
  from reads disposed of in the same run goes in that run, and the
  `disposal_run` row counts them.
- A test lists every column named like `*_by`, `by_id` or `actor` and fails if
  `principal_referenced()` does not read it in that table's clause.
- Rejected: deleting on last sign-in alone (would strip the name from records
  that still show what the person did); keeping principals forever (against
  the owner's period).
- Source: R-54, #57.

### D-65 Documentation by audience, with the executive case made honestly

- Status: Accepted
- The owner asked for the docs to explain why the project exists and what gap it
  fills, for a hospital CEO, and for the rest to be rewritten from the current
  code (R-57).
- **By audience.** `docs/index.md` is the executive case, `docs/adopting.md` the
  decision (cost, people, infrastructure, risks, how to try it), `docs/guide.md`
  the committee's walkthrough, `docs/self-hosting.md` and `docs/deploy.md` the
  operator's, `docs/privacy.md` the privacy officer's and `docs/developing.md` the
  developer's. Operator and developer material that shared a page were split so
  each reader finds theirs.
- **The pitch states its limits.** The project is open source with one
  maintainer, no support contract and no hosted service, and the repository holds
  no commercial offer. So the executive pages make the case for adopting and
  running it, and say what that costs and what it does not give, rather than
  inventing a price, a support term or a customer.
- **What was kept.** The cloud recipes in `docs/deploy.md` stay as they were
  apart from sentences the code had made false (disposal, the staff directory and
  the read trail): their provider settings are unverified and rewriting them
  would invent confidence. The crosswalk, the framework pages and the generated
  checklists are research and generated content, not descriptions of the code.
- Rejected: one long README for every reader (the executive case and the
  `make` commands do not belong in the same scroll); a pricing or services page
  (nothing in the repository supports one); translating the docs (D-61).
- Source: the owner, this session; R-57.

### D-66 The SHA-256 is computed in the page, and verified by a second implementation

- Status: Accepted
- The owner chose to make the notice true (#150) rather than remove it.
- **Synchronous, in the page.** The browser's `crypto.subtle` is asynchronous, and
  absent on some `file://` origins, while every export is built as one synchronous
  string (the PDF prints `exportHTML()`). So SHA-256 is written in
  `app/js/00-core/12-hash.js` beside the MD5 it already had, with its constants
  derived from the primes as FIPS 180-4 defines them.
- **Checked against something that is not the same code.** The test compares
  the digest with Python's `hashlib` on every padding boundary and on non-ASCII
  text, and `examples/load_export.py` recomputes both digests from an export file
  in Python, written from the rule rather than the JavaScript. A bug in either
  side, including a difference in how keys are ordered or text is escaped, fails
  the test.
- **What it covers.** The project record including its id, as canonical JSON,
  so the MD5 is the one the setup page shows. The id is exported as `project_id`
  so a reader can recompute; import ignores it.
- Rejected: an asynchronous export path (every caller and test would change for
  no gain); a signature (that needs a key, which this tool does not hold);
  putting the digest in each audit entry (the entry already carries the MD5).
- Source: the owner, on #150; R-58.

### D-67 Poison everything and look, rather than trace which fields are safe

- Status: Accepted
- The owner asked for a scan and a guard (#155).
- **A test that poisons the document.** `tests/test_injection.py` takes a
  populated project and replaces every string in it with each of 24 payloads,
  including the fields an import can fill with anything (statuses, decisions,
  dates), an extra key named like the payload, the change log, people's names,
  the search box, saved state, the legacy record, the litigation-hold history
  and an imported file. It renders every screen the project has and every
  export, and checks that nothing ran, no payload markup was parsed, and the
  text is still there as text. Because it poisons whatever the document holds, a
  field added tomorrow is covered the day it is added. A mutation removes the
  app's escape and the test must fail.
- **A ratchet for the rest.** `scripts/check_injection.py` refuses `eval`, `new
  Function`, `document.write`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, a `srcdoc` or `outerHTML`
  assignment, a `javascript:` URL, a string timer and an `on*=` handler in
  markup, and counts unescaped attribute interpolations and `innerHTML`
  assignments per file so a new one fails. The existing ones were each read and
  come from code. It is a tripwire, not proof: a value escaped for the wrong
  context is invisible to it, which the payload test covers by behavior.
- **On the server:** an AST test fails on any SQL call whose first argument is
  not a constant string, except the two named places that run trusted DDL, and a
  database test round-trips hostile text. A NUL character is a 422.
- Rejected: a sanitizer library (R-01 allows no dependency, and escaping on
  output is the right tool for text that is never meant to be markup); a
  taint-tracking analysis of the JavaScript (more machinery than the app, and
  the poison test finds the same bugs by running the code).
- Source: the owner, on #155; R-59.

### D-68 The proxy's policy names the page's script by its hash

- Status: Accepted
- The owner asked for the open issues to be fixed (#154).
- **Generated, because the hash changes with every build.**
  `scripts/build_app.py` computes the SHA-256 of the page's one inline script
  and writes the policy header to `proxy/csp.caddy`. The Caddyfile imports it,
  compose mounts it and the cloud image copies it. The build refuses a page with
  more or fewer than one inline script. The existing build-app hook already
  fails when a generated file differs, so the policy cannot go stale.
- **No `'unsafe-inline'` for script.** An injected `<script>`, an `on*` handler
  or a `javascript:` link is refused by the browser even if the page failed to
  escape something. Style stays inline, because the app styles itself.
- **The exported report has a policy of its own**, inline in the file: no script
  at all and no outside resource, so a report opened from disk or a mail
  attachment cannot run one either.
- **Where it applies.** The proxy, which is the shared workspace. The GitHub
  Pages copy cannot set headers, and a policy meta tag in the page would also
  bind the Claude artifact host, which injects its own script, so neither gets
  one.
- Rejected: a nonce (the page is one static file served the same way everywhere,
  so there is nothing to template per request); a hash maintained by hand in the
  Caddyfile (it would break the dashboard on the first build after someone
  forgot).
- Source: the owner; R-16, R-59.

### D-69 The Claude artifact mode is removed

- Status: Accepted
- The owner's decision, 2026-10-08: "I just need the true deployed app and the
  example http webpage." The dashboard no longer runs as a Claude artifact.
- **What went:** `DbStore`, the `ARTIFACT` mode and its header, saved-label,
  provenance and notice strings in all eight languages, the artifact's
  downloads and read-only handling, the copy-it-yourself fallback for views
  that cannot download, the artifact column of the comparison tables, claim
  C-13 (which asserted the artifact's identity and sign-off, and rested on a
  runtime outside the repository), and the tests that drove a stand-in for the
  artifact runtime.
- **What it bought:** the page can carry its own Content-Security-Policy. The
  artifact host injected script of its own, which a policy in the page would
  have blocked, so the page had to go without one there. With the host gone,
  the build writes the same policy into the page as a meta tag (the proxy still
  sends it as a header), which also covers the example page and a copy opened
  from disk. Issue #157 closed with it.
- **Compatibility:** exports from earlier versions may carry
  `storage.mode: "artifact"`; the schema still accepts it and says it is no
  longer produced.
- Not done: removing `artifact` from old DECISIONS and REQUIREMENTS entries
  (history stays; R-60 says what changed).
- Supersedes: R-01 (by R-60). The artifact parts of D-22 (the `Mode` enum
  listed `ARTIFACT`) remain as history; D-22's enum now has three members,
  `CONNECTING`, `LOCAL` and `API`.
- Source: the owner; R-60.

### D-29 Redaction is defined once, in SQL, and the trigger verifies the result

- Status: Accepted
- `project_log_redacted(entry)` is the single definition of what a redacted
  entry is: a **whitelist** of `at`, `by`, `hash`, the changed field's `path`,
  and a fixed marker for the text. The trigger on `project_log` permits an
  UPDATE only if the new entry **equals that function applied to the old one**,
  so it checks what was done, not what the caller says it did. A partial
  redaction, one that keeps `change.to`, a change to when or who, and un-purging
  are all refused.
- Why a whitelist: the log stores arbitrary fields the client sends, and the
  client writes the values into the prose (`text`) as well as `change.from/to`.
  The issue named only `from` and `to`; a blacklist of known fields would have
  left the identifier readable in the prose.
- "Already purged" and "written by the system" are **columns**, set only by the
  server. Were they keys inside the entry, a client could send `{"purged":
  true}` and make an entry carrying the value survive every purge.
- Deletion writes `project_deletion` (append-only, no content, no foreign key,
  so it outlives the row) inside the delete transaction. A refused or failed
  delete writes nothing.
- **Deleting is still not erasure,** by design (D-10): the history is kept so
  the record can be audited. The dialog says so, and offers the destroy step as
  a separate choice, run first so a failure does not delete the project.
- Rejected: redacting only `change.from/to` (leaves the prose); blacklisting
  known sensitive fields; making the purge delete the rows (a vanished row looks
  like a snapshot never taken, D-11); letting deletion cascade-delete the
  history (an audit trail that vanishes with its subject is not one).
- Not done: removing the identifiers of the people who made changes
  (`created_by`, `changed_by`, `by_id`), and reaching backups. Both are
  documented, and the first is #57.
- Source: #36; R-12, R-27.

## Proposed, not yet decided

### D-21 PHI detection runs in an opt-in sidecar, advisory only

- Status: **Superseded by D-51** (was Proposed: #65, #66, #67)
- The detector (OpenMed) cannot be bundled into a single-file dashboard (R-01),
  and adding it to the API image would add gigabytes and a large CVE surface. A
  separate container, absent by default, behind `POST /api/phi-check`.
- Advisory, never blocking: a governance record says "patient" constantly. The
  acknowledgment is itself recorded.
- Must not claim "no PHI detected". OpenMed publishes no aggregate F1, precision
  or recall, and says a clean result is not a compliance claim.
- Waits on R-21: the data classification is the owner's decision first.

### D-70 Evidence references are an object keyed by id, and the file is a fingerprint

- Status: Accepted
- The owner asked whether evidence could be uploaded (PDFs) and decided against
  it: "forget about the upload", with links to external sites allowed (R-61).
- **Stored at `<item>.refs`, an object keyed by reference id.** The merge rule
  replaces arrays wholesale, so an array would lose one of two references added
  at the same time; keyed by id, both survive, and removal is a `null` at one
  key. `server/tests/test_refs_merge.py` shows both against PostgreSQL.
- **A file is a name, a size and a SHA-256, computed in the browser.** It uses
  Web Crypto when the page has it and the page's own SHA-256 (D-66) when it does
  not, because Web Crypto is absent on plain http. The two are tested against
  `hashlib` at every padding boundary. The cap is 256 MB because the file is read
  into memory in one piece; hashing in chunks needs the page's own SHA-256 to be
  incremental, which it is not.
- **A link goes through `safeUrl()`**: http and https only, no credentials, no
  whitespace or control characters, 2,000 characters at most. The reader of a
  stored record runs it again, so a record written by something else (an import,
  an API call) cannot carry `javascript:` into a link.
- **Markdown links are `[title](address)` with parentheses encoded**, not the
  angle-bracket form, because `encodeURIComponent` leaves parentheses alone (a
  bug the test found) and a reader of the file cannot tell `(<url>)` from raw
  HTML.
- **Rejected:** uploading files to the server (this tool would then hold documents
  that may name a patient, with retention, disposal and breach duties it was
  designed to avoid); an array of references (loses concurrent adds); fetching a
  link to check it or to preview it (an outbound request on the reader's behalf,
  against C-80).
- Source: the owner; R-61.

### D-71 Notes are parsed to a tree, and both outputs are written from it

- Status: Accepted
- The owner asked for formatting in the notes field, with links to outside sites
  allowed, and for protection against injection. The subset is bold, italic,
  flat lists and http(s) links (R-62).
- **One tree, two writers.** `mdParse()` builds blocks of inline runs. `mdHTML()`
  escapes every run; `mdInlineMarkdown()` writes the subset back with every other
  special character escaped. Neither looks at the source again, so the structure
  of the output is the parser's, whatever the text holds. The alternative, a
  library that renders Markdown to HTML and then a sanitizer, was rejected: it
  is a third-party dependency in a page that must be one file (R-60), and
  sanitizing after the fact is the pattern whose misses are the standing source
  of XSS.
- **Not a full Markdown.** No nesting of lists, no tables, no headings, no
  images, no autolinks, no raw HTML. Each one is either a way to carry markup or
  a request an outside server (an image) when a record is read. A line that looks
  like one is shown as text.
- **The address is always shown.** A link written `[safe words](https://elsewhere)`
  is the standard disguise for a phishing link, so the report prints the address
  beside the words.
- **Bounded.** The first 50,000 characters are parsed and the rest is shown as
  plain text; nesting stops at three levels; every pattern is anchored at the
  position being read. `tests/test_markdown.py` times input built to make a
  parser crawl.
- **Scope.** Evidence or notes (CHAI and OPTICA) and a checkpoint's rationale.
  The model card's long fields, the decline reason and the setup notes stay plain
  text for now.
- Source: the owner; R-62.

### D-72 The cloud proxy rebuilds Caddy with a patched Go, until upstream does

- Status: Accepted (as a fix to a failing required check; revert condition
  below)
- The image scan began failing on 2026-10-09 with no change in this repository:
  the official `caddy:2` image of 2026-10-05 (Caddy v2.11.7) is built with Go
  1.26.8, which has two HIGH denial-of-service fixes pending in `net/http` and
  `crypto/tls` (CVE-2026-78667, CVE-2026-97031). A newer scanner database also
  flags `golang.org/x/net` v0.59.0 (CVE-2026-78669). The proxy is the process
  every request reaches first, and the newest official image was the one pinned.
- **What changed:** `proxy/Dockerfile` builds the same Caddy release from source
  in the official `caddy:2-builder` image (Go 1.27.2), with `golang.org/x/net`
  raised to v0.60.0 and the standard modules only, and copies the binary into the
  official `caddy:2` runtime image. Both images are pinned by digest.
  `tests/test_proxy_image.py` builds and runs it and checks it is the release
  `compose.yaml` pins with the same modules, and that a different release is
  noticed.
- **Rejected:** a `.trivyignore` entry (it weakens the check that found a real
  issue, which the repository rules forbid); waiting for upstream (every pull
  request would stay blocked on `tests passed`).
- **Not changed:** the local compose stack still runs the official image, which
  the scan reports without blocking; it is reached only from the network an
  operator chooses.
- **Revert when** an official `caddy:2` is built with a fixed Go and a fixed
  `golang.org/x/net`: drop the build stage and the `COPY --from`, and remove
  `test-proxy-image` with it.
- Source: GitHub Actions run 37977974877 (the image scan on PR #165).

### D-73 The policy and injection suites run in three browser engines

- Status: Accepted
- The page's Content-Security-Policy is enforced by each browser's own
  implementation, and a hospital's workstations are not all Chromium. The
  page-policy (`tests/test_csp.py`) and injection (`tests/test_injection.py`)
  suites also run in Firefox and WebKit, in the `engines` CI job (#160).
- `TEST_BROWSER` chooses the engine, Chromium by default. An unknown value is an
  error, not a fallback, so a typo in the CI matrix cannot run Chromium twice
  and call it cross-browser. `tests/test_workflows.py` fails if the job, either
  engine or either suite goes missing.
- **What the first runs found:** WebKit reports the app's refused `file://`
  request for `/api/health` as a page error even though the app catches it, so
  the app no longer probes for a server from a page opened from disk. Headless
  Firefox could block on the PDF export's real print dialog, so the injection
  test replaces that one frame's `print()` and checks it was reached.
- **Rejected:** running every browser suite in all three engines (most test the
  app's logic, which does not vary by engine, and would triple CI time).
- Source: #160.

### D-74 The shell asks one primary framework through a spine

- Status: Accepted; its CHAI-specific spine (`10-chai/25-spine.js`) superseded
  by D-77, where the engine provides the spine from the definition
- Step 1 of #168 (R-63). The portfolio, the exports, the change history and
  the events used CHAI's definitions directly (about thirty places), so CHAI
  could be joined by another framework but not replaced.
- **One primary per build.** The registry requires exactly one framework marked
  `primary`, and throws at boot otherwise. The portfolio needs one status, and
  folding two frameworks' judgments into one number would be meaningless (the
  same reason OPTICA never feeds CHAI's status, docs/crosswalk.md).
- **The spine** (`app/js/10-frameworks/00-registry.js`) is what the shell may
  ask: items, sections, categories, gates and their labels, a decision's class,
  the answers, phase, flags, status, next review, score, the report body, and
  optional Markdown and JSON extras and worked examples. CHAI implements it in
  `10-chai/25-spine.js`; the generic engine of step 2 will implement it from a
  definition.
- **Hooks for a framework's own controls.** A side panel (`panel`), clicks and
  changes the framework handles (`onClick`, `onChange`), an opt-in switch
  (`toggle`), and the change history's words for its keys (`describePath`,
  `statusName`). A framework without a panel hides the button that opens it.
- **Decisions have a class.** `GateClass` (go, conditional, revise, stop,
  retire) replaces regular expressions over the English option names, which
  the enum rule forbids and which a framework with other words would break.
- **What changed that a reader can see:** in the Markdown report, framework
  text (criteria, stage and checkpoint names) now goes through the same
  escaping as typed text, so a parenthesis in a criterion is written `\(`.
  This is safer for a definition written by someone else and renders the same.
- **Rejected:** a shell that asks every framework and merges the answers (two
  statuses for one project); leaving CHAI's names in the shell behind
  `typeof` checks (a framework could still not be removed).
- Found and left for step 2: catalog strings use CHAI's nouns for generic
  parts ("Stage {n}" on the portfolio track, "Checkpoints", "Principle"); and
  the server is not framework-neutral, because the retention SQL
  (`server/migrations/008_retention.sql`) decides retirement, and so when
  disposal is due, from CHAI's own "Stop" and "Retire" decisions.
- Source: #168; R-63.

### D-75 Frameworks are definitions, run by one engine (#168 PR A)

- Status: Accepted (implements the owner's decision in #168, R-63; design v2 on
  the issue)
- **The definition** is `app/frameworks/<id>/framework.json`, with the shape in
  `schema/framework.schema.json` and the rules a schema cannot state in
  `scripts/check_framework.py` (pre-commit and CI; every rule shown failing in
  `tests/test_check_framework.py`). Ids are explicit (never positional), match
  one safe pattern, and are never a prototype or reserved record key. Every word
  the engine acts on is a member of an engine enum: a status's class, a gate
  option's class, a phase's role, a flag rule. A supplement may not declare
  gates (the server attributes sign-off only on the primary's top-level
  `gates`), and a primary with gates must have a stop or retire option, so a
  project can always end and come due for disposal (R-56).
- **The build** embeds the definitions `app/frameworks.json` selects as
  `FRAMEWORK_DEFS`. The published build is pinned to CHAI plus OPTICA and any
  other config is refused, until a build of other frameworks has a place of its
  own to go (step 3). Rules across definitions (view ids, namespaces, requires,
  file suffixes) apply to that build; a definition outside it is checked alone,
  and the config must name exactly one primary.
- **The engine** (`app/js/10-frameworks/01-engine/`) computes score, phase,
  review and flags from a definition. CHAI's and OPTICA's rule functions now
  delegate to it, and their content constants are derived from the JSON. These
  are transitional, inside their own directories, until the generic renderers
  replace them (PR B). The model card's and metrics' flags are code plug-ins,
  placed in the flag list where the definition puts them.
- **Proof that nothing a reader sees changed**: `tests/test_snapshot.py` pins
  529 pieces (every view of every sample with OPTICA off and on, three
  languages, read-only, the side panel and every export) from before the port,
  and shows zero difference after it. `tests/test_engine.py` covers the engine's
  rules on stand-in definitions CHAI and OPTICA never exercise.
- **One generator writes every framework's checklist page**
  (`scripts/gen_framework_docs.py`), from the definition plus the page's own
  prose in `app/frameworks/<id>/docs.toml`. It replaces `gen_chai_checklist.py`
  (which regex-scraped the built page), `gen_optica_checklist.py` and
  `gen_optica_module.py`, and retires `data/optica_items.json`: OPTICA's
  definition holds every field it had, checked field by field. The CHAI and
  OPTICA pages are byte-identical except one sentence, which told editors to
  edit a generated file.
- **Tests that read JS now read the definitions**: the retention parity test
  (`server/tests/test_retention.py`) and the translation drift test
  (`tests/test_framework_i18n.py`). They stay tied to what the app runs because
  `tests/test_build_config.py` and `tests/test_framework_docs.py` show the page
  embeds exactly the definitions on disk, and `tests/test_engine.py` shows the
  engine ends a project on exactly CHAI's stop and retire options.
- **Rejected:** keeping JS copies of the content beside the JSON (two sources);
  a looser schema that ignores unknown fields (a typo becomes a silent no-op);
  checking every definition under `app/frameworks/` as one build (a custom
  framework outside the published build would collide with CHAI's views);
  rewriting the views and tests in the same change as the engine (a regression
  could be written into the new assertions; PR B does that against the snapshot).
- Found and filed: the OPTICA page's prose says there are no "equivalent" rows,
  but the data has three (part of #174).

### D-77 Every framework screen is the engine's, drawn from the definition

- Status: Accepted (implements the owner's decision in #168, R-63)
- **One implementation of each screen**: a section's checklist, a checkpoint's
  decision, a supplement's overview and its switched-off screen, and the
  primary's report (`app/js/10-frameworks/01-engine/20-views.js`). The rail,
  routing, record shape, spine and change-history words come from one
  registration per definition (`10-frameworks/90-register.js`). CHAI's own code
  is now only its plug-ins: the model card (form, panel, report section, flags),
  the key metrics (stage 4's slot, a flag), the T&E picker and the samples.
  OPTICA has no code at all; it is its definition.
- **Where wording differs, a definition names a whole-sentence catalog key**
  (`ui` slots: a section's eyebrow, the answered line, the overview's headings),
  never a noun the engine pastes into a sentence. CHAI and OPTICA name today's
  keys, so every translation is unchanged. A framework without a slot's key is
  refused by `check-framework` until PR B2 gives the engine neutral defaults.
- **Status tags keep their CSS names** by a status's class (done is styled as
  "met", open as "notmet"), so the report looks the same for any framework.
- **The transitional names are gone**: `STAGES`, `GATES`, `PRINCIPLES`,
  `OPTICA`, `OPTICA_ITEMS`, `allItems`, `opticaScore`, `setOpticaEnabled`,
  `scoreOf`, `STATUS` and the rest. Tests use the engine (`ENGINES`, `FACADES`,
  `setFrameworkEnabled`) or the spine. The boundary test fails if one returns.
- **Proof**: `tests/test_snapshot.py` before and after: 399 of 529 pieces are
  byte-identical (every CHAI screen, the report, every export) and the other
  130 (OPTICA's 13 chapter views on 10 samples) differ only in whitespace
  between block elements; the fixture was regenerated for those. A stand-in
  primary still drives the portfolio and every export
  (`tests/test_framework_boundary.py`), which caught the Markdown export reaching
  past the spine during this change.
- **Rejected:** keeping a JS copy of each framework's screens beside the engine
  (two implementations to keep equal); interpolating definition nouns into shell
  sentences (it breaks grammar in de, ru, he, hi and zh-Hans, per the design
  review); byte-identical output for OPTICA too (one template cannot reproduce
  two whitespace styles, and inter-block whitespace does not render).

### D-78 A framework's words: its own keys, or the engine's neutral ones

- Status: Accepted (implements the owner's decisions in #168 and R-65)
- **Every shell sentence a framework affects is a slot** (`UiSlot`, 52 of them):
  the section and checkpoint screens, the report's headings and footer, the
  portfolio's lede and track, setup, the delete dialog, three flags and the
  translation note. A definition names a catalog key for a slot or leaves it to
  the engine's neutral key (`engine.*`, in all eight catalogs). CHAI and OPTICA
  name today's keys, so their wording and every translation are unchanged (the
  snapshot shows zero difference). A definition with no slots at all is valid.
- **No noun is pasted into a sentence** (the design review: it breaks grammar in
  de, ru, he, hi and zh-Hans). A sentence that names the framework takes its
  `name`, a proper noun. The English text of a flag in an export takes the
  definition's `nouns` ("criterion" for CHAI, "item" by default).
- **The note under translated framework text is per framework**: its own slot
  (CHAI and OPTICA keep `fw.note`, whose zh-Hans text names its reviewer), the
  engine's neutral note, or, when the framework has no translation into the
  reader's language, a note that its words are in English. An English fallback
  in a right-to-left page is isolated left to right, as `t()` already did.
- **The build ships only the selected frameworks' text**: keys in a namespace
  another framework owns are left out of both catalogs, a developer's
  translation files are merged (a repeated key is refused), and
  `FRAMEWORK_LOCALES` records each framework's languages.
- **Rejected:** requiring every slot of a custom framework (an author would have
  to edit the shell's catalogs in eight languages); moving the safety footers
  into CHAI's catalog (the reviewer gate works only for shell keys, per the
  design review), so CHAI keeps them and a custom build gets neutral ones that
  start unreviewed; per-key fallback inside a supplied language (the owner chose
  complete-if-supplied).
- Source: #168; R-65; D-77.

### D-79 A build of other frameworks: `--config` with `--out`, and stamped records

- Status: Accepted (implements the owner's decision in #168, R-63; R-67)
- **The switch is two flags that go together.** `build_app.py --config FILE
  --out DIR` builds the frameworks `FILE` names into `DIR/index.html` and
  `DIR/csp.caddy`. Without them the build is the published one, and refuses any
  config other than `app/frameworks.json`'s pinned CHAI plus OPTICA. An `--out`
  that would write under `docs/`, `proxy/` or `app/` is refused, checked on the
  files it writes after following links, so a custom build can never overwrite
  the published page, the proxy's policy or the sources. `pixi run
  build-example` builds the example into the ignored `build/`.
- **The example framework** (`app/frameworks/example/`) is made up, small, and
  not in the published build. It is the thing to copy, the thing
  `tests/test_custom_build.py` drives, and its checklist page is published
  beside the guide (`docs/frameworks/custom.md`). It supplies Spanish only, so it
  also shows R-65 both ways.
- **Records carry their framework** (R-67): stamped only in a custom build, so
  the published build's records, exports and fingerprints do not change, and an
  unstamped record is read as `BUILD.legacy` (CHAI). The shell reads the build's
  own primary from the embedded `BUILD`, never from a literal.
- **Samples can be data** (`samples` in a definition: names, metadata, answers,
  and decisions as `[option, day offset, rationale]`), checked by
  `check-framework`, for a framework with no code. CHAI keeps its plug-in.
- **Everything embedded in the page's script is escaped for it** (`js_json`):
  every `<` in a definition or a catalog is written as `\u003c`, so no text can
  end the inline script and become markup. The published page is unchanged (its
  text has no `<`).
- **The stamp is not content**: searching all text skips `meta.framework`, so a
  search for part of the framework's id does not match every record.
- **The side panel is hidden when the primary has none**, so a custom build
  carries no landmark naming CHAI's model card.
- **A definition's words are escaped in the Markdown export** like a value a
  person typed: a framework's name, a status label, a checkpoint's name in a
  flag. The published build's export is unchanged (its words have nothing to
  escape); a custom definition's could have carried markup into a viewer that
  renders HTML. Found by `tests/test_custom_build.py`.
- **Rejected:** stamping every record, the published build's too (it would
  change every existing export and fingerprint for no gain, since unstamped
  already means CHAI); stamping an unstamped record when it is loaded (a build
  would silently claim the published build's records); one storage key for every
  build (a custom build would list, and could open, CHAI records it cannot
  read); a definition chosen at run time (R-63: a build is a reviewed change).
- Source: #168; design v2; R-63; R-67.

### D-81 The spelling guard lists roots and segments, and reads code's words

- Status: Proposed (built for #169; the owner has not yet confirmed it)
- **Roots, not words.** `scripts/check_spelling.py` holds British roots in
  families (-our, -re, -ce, -ise, -yse, a doubled l), and generates each root's
  inflections and prefixed forms (plural, -ed, -ing, -er, -able, -isation,
  -llist, un-, re-, mis- and the like). Words in no family are listed in
  `EXPLICIT` with their inflections spelled out, and none of them may also be
  generated. A list of exact forms missed a plural while it listed the singular
  (#169), and every other unlisted inflection would have passed the same way.
  A generated form that is not a real word is harmless: each keeps the British
  part of its root, so it can only match a British spelling. Forms that are
  American too ("analyses", "cancellation", "enrolled", "programmed") are never
  generated.
- **Segments, for the medical digraphs.** British segments that no American
  word we know of contains (`SEGMENTS` in the checker, such as the
  "haem" of the blood words) are matched anywhere in a word <!-- spelling-ok -->
  and respelled, so every inflection of a medical word is caught without being
  listed. A word British in both its segment and its ending is respelled in
  both. Each segment was checked against American look-alikes, which the tests
  pin, and narrowed where one exists: not bare "oea" or "coel" ("coelacanth"
  and "coelom" are American), and not "caesar" (the name "Caesar" is left
  alone; only the obstetric word is caught). Latin genus names keep their
  spelling (`GENERA`: "Haemophilus").
- **Left out on purpose**, because they are standard or common American
  spellings: "dialogue", "analogue" and the other -ogue words (except the
  catalog word, which CLAUDE.md names); "burnt", "dreamt", "spelt";
  "glamour"; "fulfilled", "enrolled" (the American past tense doubles the l);
  "analyses" (the plural of "analysis").
- **Words as code writes them.** The scan splits identifiers at underscores,
  hyphens, digits and case changes, so each word of a camelCase or
  SHOUTING_CASE name is checked (R-17 covers code), in any case. The ligatures
  "œ" and "æ" are read as "oe" and "ae".
- **Exemptions are narrow.** A `.spelling-allow` entry is `glob: phrase`: the
  phrase is exempt, exactly and case-sensitively, only in the files the glob
  matches, and only the phrase is blanked, so a British word elsewhere on the
  same line is still caught. An entry with no glob is refused; `*` is the
  explicit way to exempt a phrase everywhere, and needs a comment saying why.
  The GitHub Actions status function and result value are exempt only in
  `.github/workflows/*.yml`, and Python's asyncio exception only in `*.py`.
  The `spelling-ok` marker still exempts its whole line. A slash makes a path
  only when the run starts with `./`, `../` or `/`, or has a segment with a
  file extension, so two British words joined by a slash in prose are
  checked. A URL needs a scheme. The allowlist file itself is skipped, like
  the checker: each of its entries is a British phrase.
- **Nothing is skipped in silence.** A file that is not valid UTF-8 is reported
  as a problem, not passed.
- **Shown to fail:** `tests/test_check_spelling.py` checks every generated word,
  and every word of a hand-written table, in each of the nine contexts it lists
  (prose, a comment, a string, snake_case, kebab-case, camelCase, Title case,
  UPPER CASE, UPPER_SNAKE). The table names every `EXPLICIT` word and a form of
  every stem, ending, prefix and segment, and the test demands it does. It also
  checks American look-alikes, slashes in prose, both exemptions and their
  scope, a file that is not UTF-8, which files a whole-repository run reads,
  the skips and `--fix`, and breaks copies of the checker (a word, stem,
  ending, prefix or segment dropped; a stem added that generates an American
  word; an exemption widened; a kind of file no longer read) to show each is
  noticed.
- **Rejected:** listing more exact forms (the failure #169 describes, repeated
  for the next unlisted one); matching any word that contains a British stem
  (flags "enrolled" and "fulfilled", and a checker that cries wolf gets
  switched off); a dictionary dependency (a new install, and still a list);
  allowlist phrases that apply in every file (a protocol's spelling in a
  workflow exempted the same word in our prose).
- Source: #169; R-17; the verifier's findings on the first version of this
  change.
