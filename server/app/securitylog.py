"""Security events: named, structured, and separable from the application log (#38).

The only record of a delete, a purge, a rejected cross-site write, an out-of-range peer
or a 401 used to be a line of English on container stdout. `auth.py` says of a 401 that
it is "worth alerting on", and nothing could be: the signal was a substring of a
formatted sentence in an uncollected stream.

An event here has a **stable name** (``SecurityEvent``) and **fields**, and is
written as one JSON object per line tagged ``"stream": "security"``. That makes an
alert a field match, and lets a log sink keep the security stream for longer than
the application's chatter (45 CFR 164.308(a)(1)(ii)(D), 164.308(a)(6)(ii)).

Rules for what goes in an event:

* the names are an API. They are listed in docs/deploy.md and a test fails if the list
  and this enum drift apart, because an alert is written against them;
* actor and project ids, never a document, a token or a secret;
* every value is JSON-encoded, so an identity containing a quote or a newline stays
  inside its own string and cannot forge a second record.
