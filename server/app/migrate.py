"""``python -m app.migrate``: apply migrations and provision the serving role.

This is the ONE process that holds the database owner's credential. The API does
not: it connects as the restricted serving role (``app.roles``), so a compromised
API cannot disable the append-only triggers the history's value rests on (#48).

Run it as a job before the API starts (compose does: the ``migrate`` service; on a
cloud, a one-off task or job). It is idempotent, so running it on every deploy is
right: it applies any new migration, re-asserts the grants, and re-syncs the role's
password from ``APP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD``.

    python -m app.migrate                  migrate, then provision the role
    python -m app.migrate --print-grants   print the GRANTs and exit (no database)

Environment: the owner's ``DATABASE_URL`` (or ``POSTGRES_*``), and for the role
``APP_POSTGRES_USER`` (default ``chai_app``) and ``APP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD``. With no
``APP_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`` it only migrates, which is the single-role setup this
replaces and is reported as such.

After migrating it loads the build's retirement rules (``app.retirement``, D-76) from
``RETIREMENT_MANIFEST``, the path of the build's ``manifest.json``. That is required:
with no manifest, an unreadable one, or one that changes the rules of a framework it
lists without ``RETIREMENT_RULES_ACK`` set to the acknowledgment of that transition
(which the refusal prints), the job fails and provisions nothing, so the API (which
waits for it) does not start on rules nobody chose.

Exit status: 0 done, 1 an error (including a bad manifest), 2 no owner credential,
3 a change of the rules that was not acknowledged.
