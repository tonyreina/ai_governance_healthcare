-- Where one person's identifier appears, for a subject access request (#57).
-- Read-only. Run through scripts/subject_access.py, which passes :subject.
--
-- Exact columns match the identifier as a whole, ignoring case. The jsonb columns
-- match it as a substring of their text, so a match there is a place to look, not a
-- finding: an id that is a prefix of another will match both.
