"""Fail if a file uses British spelling where American is wanted.

This project is written in American English: it is built around CHAI, a US
non-profit, and aimed at US health systems, so British spellings read as
inconsistent with the subject matter. The slips are easy to miss in review
because words like "behavior" and "defense" look unremarkable.

Nothing is ever written. The check reports; --fix (pixi run fix-spelling)
prints a patch of suggestions for a person to review and apply, and a list of
the hits it has no suggestion for. Five rounds of review showed that a tool
rewriting the owner's files by heuristics keeps corrupting text it misreads
(a genus in emphasis, a link's label, <pre> and <script>, front matter,
templates, package names, French, quotations), so no path writes a file.

What is reported
----------------

Reporting is broad: a false report costs a ``spelling-ok`` marker, and a missed
one costs the rule. Every hit is reported, whatever word stands before it.

* A listed word, in any case. The list is of roots, not of words: each root's
  inflections (plurals, -ed, -ing, -er, the -isation family, un-, re- and the
  like) are generated from it, because a list of exact forms missed
  "judgements" while it listed "judgement" (#169). The British medical
  spellings are roots too (MEDICAL: "haemorrhag-", "oedem-", "oesophag-", the
  -aemia words and the rest), each with a closed set of English endings and a
  few known prefixes, and the -our and -re roots take a few closed compounds
  ("colourblind", "harbourmaster", "centrefold", "theatregoer"). A listed word
  is matched whole, so "phytoestrogen" and "proestrus" are not touched. No
  listed ending is one of the Latin endings -alis, -ium, -icus, -ica, -ae or
  -ensis, so "faecalis" and "gonorrhoeae" are never listed; a few listed English
  words do end in a Latin-looking -us or -i ("foetus", "oestrus",
  "oesophagus", "oesophagi").
* A lowercase word by its shape: it holds a British medical segment anywhere
  in it (SHAPES: haem, oedem, oesophag, oestr, foet, faec, caec, paed, aesthe
  after an-, kin-, syn-, par-, dys-, hyper-, hypo-, hyp- or cen- (so every
  anaes- word), gynae, the British leuco- stems (leucocyt-, leucopen-,
  leucodystroph-, leucotom-, leucotrien-, leucopoie-, leucoencephal-,
  leucoplak-, leucoderm-, leucaem-; leucorrhoea is caught by -rrhoe-), aetio,
  palaeo, praecord, pharmacopoei, spirochaet, sulph, tumour, -rrhoe-, -pnoe-,
  -aemia and -aemic; and -litre and -gramme at its end), and is longer than the
  segment. See by_shape(). A segment that an American word can hold by accident is
  narrowed: oe- segments count only at the start or after "a", "i", "o" or
  "y" ("videoedema" and "phytoestrogen" are American), "haem" inside a word
  only before "a" or "o" ("alphaemission"), "foet" only before an English
  ending ("infoetl"), "aesthe" only after those prefixes ("aesthetic",
  "nonaesthetic"), "leuco" only in those stems ("leucocratic", "leucoplast").

A word found by its shape is not reported when:

* it is spelled with the letters a-f alone (hex: "#faecab");
* it has a Latin ending (-us but not -ous, -ae, -ii, -alis, -icus, -ica, -icum,
  -ensis) or is one of LATIN_EPITHETS, Latin epithets whose ending looks
  English ("faecium", "haematobium");
* it contains one of SHAPE_EXCEPTIONS, words American biology spells this way
  ("caecilian", "paedomorphosis", "oestrid", "asafoetida"), or is one of
  DICTIONARY_WORDS, which the en_US dictionary accepts as American
  ("leucotomy", "pharmacopoeia").

And no word, listed or found by its shape, is reported when it is the epithet
of a binomial (see binomial()): it is a Latin epithet (epithet()): it ends in
a Latin form (-a, -ae, -i, -is, -um, -us but not -ous), does not end in an
English medical form (-ia, so every -aemia; -oea, so every -rrhoea and -pnoea;
-oma; -itis; -sis), and is not a listed word, except "foetus"
(LISTED_EPITHETS); and the word before it, past markup such as "*", "_" and
HTML tags, and on the line before if it is first on its line, is one of GENERA
or an abbreviated genus such as "E.". So "Tritrichomonas foetus", "T. foetus"
and "Enterococcus faecalis" pass, and "Severe foetus", "Staphylococcus
bacteraemia", "Neisseria gonorrhoea", "Mycoplasma oesophagitis" and "B. oedema"
are reported.

A British word that neither the list nor a shape covers passes
(tests/fixtures/spelling_corpus/unlisted.txt keeps a few), and so does a
commit message, which the check does not read. A word with an accented letter
is not English and is not read ("décentre").

Not prose, so not reported: a URL (with "://", or one of the schemes written
without it, such as mailto:, urn:, doi: and data:, starting after anything but
a letter or digit), an email address, a domain, a file name with a known
extension, a path, a digest ("sha384-..."), and a run of 16 or more characters
that looks like encoded data (see looks_encoded()). An abbreviation written
with dots ("e.g.", "i.e.") is not a file extension, so "oedema/e.g." is prose.

Words are read the way code writes them, so the parts of an identifier
(``colourPicker``, ``MAX_COLOURS``, ``data-colour-id``) are reported too, in any
case, and the ligatures "œ" and "æ" are read as "oe" and "ae".

The suggestion patch
--------------------

--fix never writes a file; there is no flag that makes it. It prints to stdout
a unified diff, which ``git apply`` takes, of suggested respellings, under a
header saying the patch is a suggestion to review before applying. Paths are
relative to the repository root. A file outside it is named as given when that
is a relative path that does not climb (".."), for `git apply` to take from
where the command ran; one named by an absolute path or with ".." cannot be
named (git apply refuses those paths), so its suggestions are left out of the
patch, said so on stderr, and make the exit 1. It
prints to stderr every other hit, for a person to fix by hand, with the reason
it is not in the patch, and exits 1 when there is any hit or a file it cannot
read.

A hit is suggested in the patch only when all of these hold (left_by()); its
imperfection is harmless, because a person reviews each hunk:

* it is listed, not found by its shape;
* it is all lowercase (a capitalized word may be a name);
* the file is Markdown, reStructuredText or plain text (.md, .rst, .txt), or
  it is in a value of app/i18n/en.json; never code, configuration or data;
* it is not in code: a fenced or indented Markdown block, a reStructuredText
  literal block or code directive, text between backticks, a line that starts
  with "import ", "from ... import ", "$ ", ">>> " or "... ", or the word after
  "import", "require" or "library";
* between it and the whitespace (or line end) around it there is nothing but,
  before, any of ``( [ " ' *`` and, after, any of ``) ] " ' * , ; : . ! ?``.

Known limits: the patch can still be wrong (a lowercase listed word in a
quotation, a name written in lowercase), which is why it is a suggestion; and
the check reads only what is listed or has a listed shape.

Quoting a source that spells a word the British way is legitimate (R-17), and
nothing here rewrites it. The check still reports it, so mark it:

* Put ``spelling-ok``, in lowercase, in a comment on the same line; that line is
  skipped.
* Add ``glob: phrase`` to ``.spelling-allow`` in the repo root, one per line.
  The phrase, matched exactly and case-sensitively, is skipped in the files the
  glob matches (``*.py``, ``.github/workflows/*.yml``; matched from the right,
  like ``PurePath.match``), and the rest of its line is still checked. ``*``
  matches every file, and needs a comment saying why.

A file that is not valid UTF-8 is reported, not skipped: a check that cannot
read a file has not checked it.

Run with no arguments, it reads every text file under the repository, by the
rule pre-commit's ``types: [text]`` uses for a file it cannot name (see
is_text()), so a whole-repository run and the hook read the same kinds of file:
a shell script, a .caddy file, .env.example and .gitignore as well as code and
documentation. Symbolic links are not read (pre-commit does not pass them; the
target is read on its own), nor anything under SKIP_DIRS. A symbolic link named
on the command line is not read either, and is said to be skipped on stderr, so
a patch never names one file twice.

tests/test_check_spelling.py pins all of this, against a corpus a verifier
built (tests/fixtures/spelling_corpus/).
