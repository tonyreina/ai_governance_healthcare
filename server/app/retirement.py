"""Which decisions end a project, from the build's own framework definition (R-66).

``retention_due()`` starts a project's retention clock when it is retired (R-56),
and what counts as retired is a property of the framework the dashboard was built
with: a checkpoint option whose class is ``stop`` or ``retire``. The build writes
those pairs into ``docs/app/manifest.json`` (``scripts/build_app.py``) from the same
definitions the page embeds, and the migrate job loads them into ``retirement_rule``
here, as the database owner, under the migration lock (D-76).

The sync never changes disposal silently:

* a manifest governs only the frameworks it lists. Rules of a framework it does not
  list are left as they are, so the records of an earlier primary keep retiring by
  their own rules, and the job reports them;
* any change, a pair added or a pair removed or a new primary, is made only when
  ``RETIREMENT_RULES_ACK`` equals :func:`transition_ack` of that whole change: every
  rule the table holds before and after it, the primary before and after, and the
  history row it follows. Otherwise the job refuses, names every project whose
  disposal would start or stop being due, prints the value to set, and exits
  non-zero. Because the value binds the change it was printed for and the row it
  follows, it accepts that change once and nothing else: not a different change
  between the same primary rule sets, not a stale manifest undoing a newer one, and
  not the same change again later;
* a sync that changes nothing (the same rows, the same primary) needs no
  acknowledgment, so the default build on a fresh database (whose seed is that
  build's rule set) starts without one;
* a missing or malformed manifest, or a primary with nothing that ends a project,
  fails the job. There is no fallback to CHAI's rules or to the table as it stands.

Every change is a row in the append-only ``retirement_rule_change`` and a security
event.
