"""Identity, taken from a reverse proxy and from nowhere else.

The browser app does not authenticate. A proxy in front of this service --
Google Cloud IAP, an AWS ALB with an ``authenticate-oidc`` listener rule, Azure
Easy Auth, or the Caddy front door in this repository's compose stack --
terminates the SSO flow and stamps the authenticated user onto every request as
a header. This module reads that header and turns it into an :class:`Identity`.

The one hard requirement
------------------------
**This service must be unreachable except through the proxy.** It trusts a
request header, and a header is trivially forged::

    curl -H 'X-Forwarded-Email: cmo@hospital.org' https://api.example.org/api/me

If that request can reach the container from anywhere other than the proxy,
anyone can be anyone. No code in this file can make up for a routable port.
Network isolation is the security boundary:

* **Google Cloud** -- Cloud Run ingress ``internal-and-cloud-load-balancing``,
  so only the load balancer carrying IAP can reach the revision.
* **AWS** -- ECS tasks in private subnets, no public IP, task security group
  accepting inbound *only* from the ALB's security group.
* **Azure** -- Easy Auth runs in front of the app container; do not expose a
  second ingress port past it.
* **Compose** -- the ``api`` service publishes no ports; only Caddy does.

Two second locks are available, both off by default and both defense in depth
rather than a substitute for closing the port:

``TRUSTED_PROXY_CIDR``
    Reject any request whose TCP peer address is outside these ranges. This is
    why the container does **not** run uvicorn with ``--proxy-headers``: that
    would rewrite the peer address from ``X-Forwarded-For``, which the client
    controls, and the check would be checking the attacker's own claim.

``PROXY_SHARED_SECRET``
    Reject any request that does not carry a secret only the proxy knows.

Identity is never read from the request body, a query parameter, or a cookie.
The audit log's ``by`` field is overwritten with the proxy identity on write
for the same reason.
