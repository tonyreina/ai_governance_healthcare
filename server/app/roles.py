"""The database role the API serves traffic as, and exactly what it may do.

The append-only guarantees in ``001_init.sql``, ``003_version_access.sql`` and
``005_disposal.sql`` (a log that refuses UPDATE, a version history that refuses
DELETE, a tombstone that refuses everything) are triggers. A table's OWNER can
``ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE TRIGGER``, ``DROP TRIGGER`` or ``TRUNCATE`` in one
statement, and the API used to run migrations and serve traffic as the same role,
which owned every table (and, in the compose stack, was a superuser). So the
triggers constrained the application's bugs, not the application, and not anything
holding its credential (#48).

So there are two roles:

* the **owner** (``POSTGRES_USER`` / ``DATABASE_URL``) creates the schema. Only
  ``python -m app.migrate`` holds it, as a one-shot job;
* the **serving role** (``APP_POSTGRES_USER``, default ``chai_app``) is what the API
  connects as. It is a plain login role with the table privileges below and
  nothing else: it cannot disable or drop a trigger, truncate, alter a table or
  create one.

``GRANTS`` is the whole list, and a test fails if a table exists that is not in it,
so adding a table without deciding what the API may do to it is not possible.
