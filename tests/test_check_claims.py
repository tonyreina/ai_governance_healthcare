"""The security-claims checker, tested by trying to make it accept a lie.

docs/security-claims.md lists every security property this project asserts, where
it asserts it (with the sentence quoted), and the test that enforces it. The
checker is what stops that page being decoration, so it has to be shown to fail:

* a quote that is no longer in the file it cites (the doc changed under the row);
* evidence that points at a file or a test that does not exist;
* evidence that exists but that CI never runs, which is how #32 happened;
* a claim marked enforced with nothing enforcing it;
* a claim that is not enforced and does not say so, or says so without an issue.

The "known violation" statuses are the honest part: a claim the code does not back
is allowed to stay in the inventory, but only as `violated`, with an issue, in
plain sight. What is not allowed is a claim that looks enforced and is not.
